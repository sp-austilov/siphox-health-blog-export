Almost Malthusian limits to scaling globalization and the modern connected society seem to be manifesting themselves. Fortunately, some of our technology has proved resilient in the face of the crisis. Effective vaccines were developed almost immediately, then tested and approved in record time. Zoom and other online services scaled massively with the support of computing and communications hardware in data centers to keep the world functioning. The bad news is that we\u2019ve also had some disastrous failures.\nHard Problems\nTesting for coronavirus infections has not met even 0.1% of global demand. Although researchers (e.g.\u00a0Michael Mina at Harvard) [1] have shown that testing needs to be done quickly, frequently, and at a massive scale to be effective, Americans (saying nothing about the third world) are still waiting for hours in long lines to get tests, the results of which come back days later.\nOne possible explanation for this failure to scale testing would be that it\u2019s \u201ca hard problem.\u201d Certainly, that\u2019s not untrue. However, connecting hundreds of millions of people all over the world simultaneously via real-time video and audio is also a \u201chard problem.\u201d Just 50 years ago most people would call it science fiction (though\u00a0Bell [2] made some impressive early efforts). Despite being a \u201chard problem,\u201d video chat is an information problem, not a matter or energy problem, and humans have gotten very good\u00a0at solving information problems.\nIf gas mileage improved at the same speed as hard disk storage space, a typical car would be able to drive 4 million miles on a gallon of fuel and accelerate 0\u201360 in 0.003 seconds [3].\nInformation problems are unique in that they benefit from small size and low power. A 10 nanometer ) transistor (1 * 10^\u20139 meters = 1 nm provides the same computation as a 100 nm transistor but at a lower cost and using less power. Besides the difficulty of manufacturing a 10nm feature, there is no tradeoff. Smaller is better.\nIn matter and energy problems, smaller does not equal better. The tradeoff becomes immediately clear when you consider the simple case of miniaturizing a space heater or a car. The pits on a Blu-ray disk are much smaller than those on a CD-ROM, but each pit holds the same data, and therefore each pit on the Blu-ray disk provides the same utility with essentially no tradeoff (besides the need for a smaller wavelength blue laser readout). A tiny version of a space heater or a tiny car would have to use alternative physics to deliver the same utility as their normal-sized counterparts.\nSo the question to ask is not whether diagnostic testing is a \u201chard problem,\u201d but whether it\u2019s a matter and energy problem or an information problem.\u00a0The fact is that diagnostic testing is an information problem that obeys the same law as computing: smaller and less power is better.\u00a0The result of a diagnostic assay is a number, in the case of a complex quantitative test, or a boolean (true or false), in the case of a simpler test. The smaller, cheaper, and more efficient the device that gives this number or boolean, the better.\u00a0There is no tradeoff.\nA zoom call in every screen\n\nLeft: Herbert Hoover Campaign Pin [4]\nWhen COVID struck, America was able to provide its citizens with \u201ca zoom call in every screen,\u201d with near flawless performance and low cost. This was possible because innovation, performance, form factor, cost, and scalability have been driving the sale of products like data-center transceivers (which shuttle the massive amounts of real-time data needed for video calls) long before Covid. The entire trillion-dollar chip industry is geared toward providing more for less year after year.\nThe medical diagnostics industry, despite best efforts on the part of all the major players, has not been able to meet even 0.1% of the potential demand for COVID testing in 2020, even after the approval process was pared down to a bare-bones Emergency Use Authorization. The reality is that this is mainly due to the lack of fast-paced innovation and general lack of focus on cost, form factor, and scalability in the diagnostics industry over the last several decades.\nForging Ahead\nThe need for innovation in testing is no longer a matter of debate, and thousands of people are working on bringing next-generation diagnostics to market. The FDA has recently approved several at-home tests for COVID (e.g.\u00a0Elume) [5] and more are in the works, including one being developed by SiPhox.\nAt SiPhox we develop optical chips, which are semiconductor chips that process light (photons) instead of electrical signals (electrons) for biotech applications. In March we came to the inevitable conclusion that the most valuable thing we could do as a startup was to tackle COVID testing. Building anything else during COVID would be the equivalent of building luxury cars instead of Jeeps and tanks during WWII, as Diedrik likes to say.\nKnowing that diagnostics, at its core, is an information problem that can benefit from all the same improvements in cost, size, and scalability that chips have brought to other data acquisition, transduction, and transmission problems, we ran the numbers and calculated that tests using conventional silicon micro-ring biosensors could be produced at very low cost, in the billions per month using just a small fraction of US chip-fab capacity [6]. What\u2019s more, these chips would use much smaller quantities of precious reagents (such as antibodies) than a typical paper strip test, while analyzing up to 100 biomarkers in parallel.\nThe semiconductor industry will do for basic wet lab diagnostics (such as COVID testing) what it did for photography \u2014 make something complex, large and, expensive, cheap, small, and ubiquitous. In the limit, this will fundamentally change the way humanity approaches pandemic response and health monitoring in general.\nBuilding our COVID test\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, we quickly taped-out [7] a COVID sensor chip, moved into a Bio Safety Level 2+ lab space near MIT called Nest Bio, opened several university collaborations, and started building a team around our mission. In parallel to completing Y Combinator, we generated impressive data both for directly detecting the COVID nucleocapsid protein, and for reading out CRISPR-based molecular (RNA\/DNA) tests. Subsequently, we raised a $5.8M seed round led by Khosla Ventures, and are hard at work getting the OneLab at-home Covid test ready for Emergency Use Authorization approval by the FDA.\n\nTape-out set for making old-school tape masks [8]. This is how chips were made in the 70\u2019s and chip designers still use the term \u2018tape-out.\u2019\n2020 was a tough year, but it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the opportunity to make progress in a crisis. We\u2019re immensely excited about the excellent progress being made in response to COVID on many fronts, and we hope to contribute our developments to making pandemics like this a thing of the past, and changing how biomarker data is collected and used (more on this in a future post).\nAre you an A+ engineer or scientist with systems, electro-optics, photonics, synthetic biology, microfluidics, or assay development experience?

It is not only a cornerstone in the treatment and management of diabetes but also a focal point in public health discussions, economic considerations, and medical research. Insulin\u2019s role transcends individual health, affecting societal and economic aspects, and remains a key area of focus in efforts to improve health outcomes and quality of life for those with diabetes. Its significance in the American health context is highlighted by the prevalence of diabetes and its associated health risks. Without proper insulin management, individuals with diabetes face a heightened risk of severe health complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, vision loss, and nerve damage. Thus, insulin therapy is not just a means of managing diabetes but also a critical tool in preventing these life-threatening conditions.\nWhat is fasting insulin?\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar (aka glucose) levels. Glucose, the building blocks of carbohydrates, is a major source of energy for our cells. After eating, our bodies secrete insulin in response to circulating glucose to prompt our cells to either store it for future use or immediately convert it to energy. Essentially, insulin helps to regulate blood sugar levels by reducing the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream.\nAs the name suggests, fasting insulin is a measurement of insulin levels in the bloodstream after a period without glucose-containing food or beverages, typically for 8-12 hours to bring insulin and glucose levels back to baseline. Assessing fasting insulin levels can provide valuable insight into an individual\u2019s metabolic health and their risk of developing insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.\nWhy measure fasting insulin levels? A link to longevity.\nMeasuring fasting insulin levels can help identify early signs of insulin resistance, a condition where the body\u2019s cells become less sensitive to insulin, leading to the pancreas producing more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Early detection of insulin resistance can help prevent the progression of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Moreover, monitoring insulin levels can provide a more comprehensive understanding of one\u2019s metabolic health and inform necessary lifestyle and dietary changes to improve it.\nChronically high fasting insulin levels, known as hyperinsulinemia, can be an indicator of insulin resistance and other health issues. High insulin levels have been linked to several health conditions, including metabolic syndrome, heart disease, cancer, cognitive decline, reproductive health issues, and fatty liver disease.\nA meta-analysis of three studies (n=14,723) identified a close-to-significant association (p=0.058) between relatively higher fasting insulin levels and an increased all-cause mortality risk. This analysis included participants from Sweden and the US, ranging in age from 20 to older than 65 years old. The pooled relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.00-1.27) for the highest compared to the lowest category of fasting insulin levels. There was no significant evidence of heterogeneity across the studies [1].\nInterpretation of insulin test results and optimal ranges\nInsulin levels can vary depending on several factors, including whether or not you have fasted before the test. Fasting insulin tests require you to avoid eating or drinking anything except water for 8-12 hours before the test. If you have not fasted, your insulin levels could be higher due to the body\u2019s response to food intake, which might not provide an accurate representation of your baseline insulin levels.\nGeneral reference ranges for fasting insulin levels vary by laboratory, but a common range is between 1.90 and 23.00 \u00b5IU\/mL (micro international units per milliliter). It is essential to note that these reference ranges may not necessarily represent optimal insulin levels for overall health.\nWhile there is no scientific consensus on the optimal insulin levels, some experts suggest that a fasting insulin level below 10 \u00b5U\/mL is ideal for maintaining good metabolic health. Lower insulin levels are often associated with better insulin sensitivity and a reduced risk of insulin resistance, which can lead to various health issues such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions.\nHow to Lower Fasting Insulin Levels\nGiven what we know about the systematic secretion of insulin in response to glucose, a high level of insulin in the blood is associated with high circulating blood glucose levels. But what can we do to naturally alleviate this? In other words, how can a person regain insulin sensitivity and lower blood glucose levels?\n\nA high BMI can worsen the body\u2019s sensitivity to insulin so consider healthy ways of losing weight. [2]\n\nIncorporate exercise into your daily routine. While there is no consensus on whether a greater intensity of exercise yields higher insulin sensitivity and lower HbA1c (learn more about HbA1c here), some studies do support that HIIT (high-intensity interval training) may be as salubrious as moderate-intensity exercise. [3]\u00a0Either way, get up and get moving!\nStay active while you\u2019re seated by doing \u201csoleus push-ups\u201d (calf raises). [4]\n\nEat fiber-rich foods before carbs to slow glucose absorption and dampen glucose spikes. [5]\n\nGet 7-8 hours of quality sleep every night. [6]\n\nConsider intermittent fasting, which has been shown to potentially improve insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and appetite. [7]\n\nA CGM (continuous glucose monitor) used over several weeks may help you pinpoint which foods spike your glucose and, therefore, insulin.

However, during aging, chronic, low-grade inflammation \u2013 called inflammaging \u2013 develops, which contributes to the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases. Inflammation is also associated with depression and other chronic illnesses.\n\n\nhs-CRP\n\nHomocysteine\u00a0(high range)\n25-(OH) Vitamin D\n\nFerritin\u00a0(high range)\n\nMetabolic Fitness[2]\nMetabolic fitness is the condition of a robust and healthy set of cellular mechanisms that produce energy from our food and environment to power every process in the human body. Poor Metabolic Fitness is associated with worse brain function, energy, memory, mood, skin health, fertility, and like inflammation, puts us at greater risk for chronic diseases.\n\nHemoglobin A1C\nFasting Insulin\nTrig:HDL-C Ratio\n25-(OH) Vitamin D\n\n\nBalance[3]\n\nYour Balance score includes hormonal and nutritional markers. Balance means maintaining the appropriate amount (not too high or too low) of hormones and critical vitamins\/minerals. This is key to keeping our internal environment running at its peak.\n\n\n\nTestosterone (Male)\n\nEstradiol\u00a0(Female)\n\nTestosterone:Cortisol Ratio\u00a0(Male)\n\nDHEA-S\u00a0(Male)\nFolate\n\nFerritin\u00a0(low range)\n\nHomocysteine (low range)\n\nThyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)\n\nCardiovascular[4]\n\nYour Cardiovascular score includes markers that have the potential to lead to heart disease. Poor Cardiovascular health puts individuals at risk for shortened lifespan and decreased quality of life. Tracking these markers allows you to optimize your diet and lifestyle to stay healthier, longer.\n\n\nHDL-C\nLDL-C\nTotal Cholesterol:HDL-C Ratio\nTriglycerides\nApoA1\nApoB\nApoB:ApoA Ratio\n\nHormone+ Panel\nThe Hormone+ Panel tests 7-8 hormonal markers in addition to our standard 17 tests.\nMale Panel:\n\nEstradiol\nLH\nSHBG\nProlactin\nFSH\nPSA\nAlbumin\nFree Testosterone\n\n\nFemale Panel:\n\nLH\nFolate\nVitamin B12\nAnti-Mullerian Hormone\nSHBG\nProlactin\nDHEA-S\n\nThyroid+ Panel\nThe Thyroid+ Panel tests 3 additional thyroid markers on top of our standard 17 tests.\n\nFree T3\nFree T4\nTPO Antibody\n\nMetabolic+ Panel\nThe Metabolic+ Panel tests 10 additional thyroid markers on top of our standard 17 tests.\n\nAlbumin\nALT\nAST\nCreatinine\neGFR\nFasting Glucose\nHOMA-IR\nLp(a)\nBilirubin\nBlood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)\n\n\nWearable Device Data\nActivity[5]\n\n\n\nYour weekly activity average includes number of steps and minutes spent engaging in different zones of exercise intensity.\n\n\nDaily Steps\nMinutes Spent in Low Intensity Activities\nMinutes Spent in Medium Intensity Activities\nMinutes Spent in High Intensity Activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep[6]\n\n\nYour sleep score reflects your average sleep duration and quality.\n\nSleep Total Duration\nREM Sleep\nDeep Sleep\nSleep Efficiency\n\nHeart Efficiency[7]\n\nHeart Efficiency is a measure of your current heart health and athleticism.

However, with the advent of new medical technologies, the door is opening to more frequent and comprehensive monitoring. SiPhox Health\u2019s at-home blood testing service epitomizes this progress, providing a more thorough and frequent insight into personal health that transcends the traditional annual check-up.\nDuring an annual physical, the standard blood tests are used to assess aspects of health such as: the balance of essential minerals and electrolytes, liver and kidney function, blood cell status, and markers like cholesterol and blood sugar levels that indicate risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. While these tests offer a valuable snapshot of one\u2019s overall health, they have limitations in their breadth and the frequency with which they are tested.\n\nStandard yearly blood test versus SiPhox Health\n\nSiPhox Health\u2019s at-home blood tests fill these critical gaps by offering a more expansive range of biomarkers, coupled with the convenience of more regular testing right from your home. Our tests go beyond what\u2019s typically covered in a standard physical, giving a more comprehensive health overview. Additional areas covered by SiPhox Health\u2019s at-home testing include:\n\nInflammation Markers: Beyond standard CRP, SiPhox Health tests for hs-CRP, Ferritin, and Homocysteine, providing a more detailed view of inflammation, a key factor in chronic diseases.\nMetabolic Health Indicators: By measuring markers like HbA1c, Insulin, and thyroid function, SiPhox Health provides a broader understanding of metabolic function and associated risks.\nHormonal Health Assessment: Our panel extends to hormones like Cortisol, DHEA-S, Estradiol, and Testosterone, vital for understanding physiological stress responses, and overall hormonal balance.\nCardiovascular Health: SiPhox Health goes beyond traditional cholesterol testing with ApoA1 and ApoB measurements, offering a more detailed assessment of lipid-related cardiovascular risk.\n\nThough not a substitute for your annual bloodwork, SiPhox Health serves as an essential adjunct, providing deeper insights into your health. Perfect for anyone navigating lifestyle changes, new medications, or monitoring chronic conditions, our service offers the convenience of assessing 17 crucial biomarkers right from your home, on your schedule. Tracking your health has never been easier or more insightful.\nThe Scientific Benefits of SiPhox Health include:\n\n\nEnhanced Frequency: Our regular testing can detect health marker changes more swiftly than annual screenings.\n\nConvenience and Comfort: The ease of SiPhox Health\u2019s at-home testing eliminates the need for scheduling clinic visits and enduring long waits.\n\nHealth Data: SiPhox Health reports provide insights tailored to individual health profiles, enabling more informed healthcare decisions.\n\nEarly Detection and Prevention: The comprehensive nature of our testing facilitates the early detection of potential health issues, allowing for timely intervention.\n\nData-Driven Lifestyle Adjustments: With a more detailed health profile, individuals can adjust their lifestyle choices more precisely to match their health needs.\n\nWhat\u2019s included with a SiPhox Health test panel:\n\n\nAt-Home Convenience: Our kit comes to your door. Specially designed for easy, low-pain blood collection through a simple fingerprick method.\n\nFlexible Pricing: Access our services at $345 for a one-time test, or embrace regular health monitoring with subscriptions at just $85 per test.\n\nComprehensive Biomarker Analysis: Our base panel examines 17 essential biomarkers, plus delves deeper with our Hormone+ and Thyroid+ add-on panels for a full health spectrum.\n\nIntegrated Health Tracking: We support sleep and activity tracking across more than 200 wearable devices, ensuring you get a holistic view of your health, with results delivered swiftly within 2-5 business days.\n\nWith SiPhox Health, individuals gain a scientific edge in health monitoring, empowering you to take a proactive, informed approach to your health on your terms.\nCheck out the table below for an overview of our offerings, and for an in-depth look at the biomarkers we assess and their significance \u2013 visit our detailed guide at\u00a0https:\/\/home.siphoxhealth.com\/what-we-measure.

Whether supporting immune, musculoskeletal, or brain health, Vitamin D is definitely a valuable player in maintaining overall health and wellness.\nThe History of Vitamin D\nBut to really understand Vitamin D, we need to go back to the early 1600s when rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults were first described. Coinciding with the Industrial Revolution, a combination of indoor occupations, smog, and decreased dietary calcium intake may have contributed to Vitamin D deficiency. Without sufficient Vitamin D, calcium is not properly absorbed, and bones become soft, weak, and deformed. [1] [2]\nCenturies later in Great Britain, Sir Edward Mellanby, a biochemist, was concerned with the incidence of rickets in the United Kingdom and hypothesized that the disease was caused by a dietary deficiency. To test this, he fed dogs a strict diet of oatmeal (the main diet of Scottish folk who had the highest incidence of rickets at the time) and kept them away from sunlight. Once the dogs developed rickets, he noticed that they could be cured with cod liver oil. To determine whether it was Vitamin A or another vitamin that was responsible, Professor Elmer McCollum of Johns Hopkins University decided to conduct an experiment of his own. By destroying Vitamin A from the cod liver oil, McCollum identified that a new vitamin, which they called Vitamin D, was the true component responsible for curing the disease. [3]\nEventually, dietary supplementation and fortification of food and infant formula led to a decrease in nutritional rickets. However, Vitamin D deficiency prevails. Social and cultural shifts including preferences for fair skin, a sedentary lifestyle, health concerns over skin cancer, time constraints, and many other factors have led to decreased ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure.\nWho is susceptible to deficiency?\nA few characteristics can make a person more susceptible to deficiency. Living in regions with low sunlight such as northern latitudes, especially during the winter months, can limit the amount of natural Vitamin D that your body synthesizes, even if you spend time outside. People with darker skin tones are prone to being deficient because melanin inhibits Vitamin D synthesis. As people age, the skin becomes less efficient at synthesizing Vitamin D. Additionally, since Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, people who are overweight or obese may have Vitamin D sequestered in fat cells, which results in lower circulating Vitamin D concentrations. Ultimately, geographic location, melanin levels, age, and obesity status, in addition to diet, disorders, and medication, could all potentially impact Vitamin D availability.\nSo if Vitamin D is so important, how can we prevent deficiency?\nChances are, when you think about Vitamin D, you think of sunlight. Spending about 10-30 minutes in the sun a few times a week, exposing your skin to the UVB rays, can help your body naturally synthesize Vitamin D. The amount of time needed varies based on factors such as your skin type, geographic location, and UV index. If you live in an area without as much sunlight, you can try a UV lamp. Diet is another way to obtain Vitamin D. Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and trout are excellent sources. Egg yolks and mushrooms also contain some, but many foods nowadays such as milk, orange juice, breakfast cereals, and yogurt are often fortified with Vitamin D. Supplements are a convenient, accessible option if you have dietary restrictions or limited sun exposure. If you are concerned about your Vitamin D levels or have specific health conditions, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional. They can assess your Vitamin D status and recommend appropriate treatment options based on your individual needs. [4]\nWhy You Should Test Your Vitamin D Regularly\nUnderstanding your Vitamin D levels is crucial for maintaining good health, especially considering the various factors that can lead to deficiency. Regular testing can help you identify if you\u2019re getting enough Vitamin D from your diet, sunlight exposure, or supplements. At Siphox Health, we offer an easy-to-use, at-home testing kit that allows you to monitor your Vitamin D levels conveniently. Regular testing is a proactive step in managing your health and ensuring you maintain the optimal Vitamin D level for bone health, immune function, and overall well-being.\n\n&nbsp;\nDisclaimer: If you have any medical questions or concerns, please talk to your healthcare provider.

Discover how combining sleep data from devices like Oura rings or Apple Watches with blood biomarker data can transform your health and well-being.\nMany of us rely on wearable devices to monitor our sleep, hoping to uncover the secrets to better rest and more energy. However, these devices often leave us with more questions than answers. It\u2019s not just about tracking steps or sleep stages; it\u2019s about understanding the deeper connections between different aspects of our health. If you\u2019re looking to improve your diet, exercise, or sleep habits, the following insights can help you determine what changes might enhance your overall well-being.[1]\nTo explore these connections, we analyzed SiPhox user data to identify relationships between blood biomarker data and connected wearable device data. Surprisingly, we discovered a strong correlation between lipids and sleep data, particularly in women over the age of 40. These findings could provide valuable insights for those looking to make informed changes to their health routines. [2]\nFirst, a quick explanation of our data exploration methodology and a few definitions\nMethodology\nWearable data was averaged over the two weeks preceding the associated blood tests.\nFor correlation analysis, we used Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables) to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two datasets. We further visualized these relationships by creating plots with an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression line (a straight line that best fits the data points), which helped illustrate the trend and strength of the correlations. This methodology allowed us to effectively identify and visualize meaningful correlations within the data. [3] [4]\nCholesterol \u2014 the Good, the Bad, and the Transport:\nCholesterol can be categorized into HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), commonly referred to as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol.\nLDL-C (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol is deposited into the arteries, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. [5]\nHDL-C refers to the cholesterol carried by Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) (a type of protein that carries cholesterol in the blood) -containing HDL particles. HDL particles pick up harmful cholesterol in the arteries and then carry everything to the liver (directly or indirectly), where cholesterol is repurposed or removed. [6] [7]\nRapid Eye Movement Sleep:\nRapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a phase that lasts approx. 25% of your total sleep duration, where (alongside other activities) your brain rests and repairs itself so you can wake up feeling refreshed and energized. [8]\nThe cholesterol-sleep relationship in women over the age of 40\nThere was a strong positive correlation between HDL-C and REM sleep for women over 40 years of age. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation between the same markers in neither men of the same age group (correlation coefficient = 0.08) nor in younger women (correlation coefficient = -0.13).\n\nUnsurprisingly, we saw a similarly positive correlation between APOA1 and REM sleep, which is to be expected given the relationship between HDL-C (passenger) and APOA1 (vehicle).\n\nFor additional graphs on the relationship between bad cholesterol (LDL-C, APOB) and sleep data in the same age group, please refer to the Supplementary Data section.\nHow does this differ for men?\nGiven the strong correlation in women, one might assume that there\u2019d be a similar correlation in men. But our data says otherwise.\nThe correlation between HDL-C and REM, for men over 40, was only 0.08, which is essentially a non-existent correlation and certainly a far weaker one than the 0.53 correlation coefficient in women of the same age group! For all intents and purposes, our data indicates that there is no correlation between cholesterol biomarkers and sleep data in men over 40.\n\nSo, why are cholesterol and sleep related?\nIt is unclear whether the relationship we\u2019re observing is causative or correlative. Perhaps one of the two, HDL-C or REM sleep, impacts the other. Just as likely, they\u2019re both independently impacted by another set of biomarkers or activities, such as an active lifestyle or hormone status.\nThat being said, here are a few mechanistic connections between REM and HDL-C:\n\nHDL-C particles have significant anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation is known to disrupt sleep patterns. So this reduced inflammation could contribute to more stable and prolonged REM sleep.\nHDL-C particles support endothelial function, which is vital for healthy blood circulation. Improved endothelial function could improve circulation to the brain during sleep, and subsequent REM sleep duration. [9]\n\n\nThese connections exist in both men and women, though. If either or both of these are the root cause of the correlation, then why don\u2019t we see this in men? Or a younger cohort of women?\nIf you\u2019re interested in seeing how your cholesterol and sleep are correlated, pick up an at-home blood testing kit from SiPhox.

There is no shortage of news stories covering the reality of those with higher incomes having higher life expectancies than those in lower financial brackets. Healthcare services such as clinical diagnostic testing may be out of reach for those who could really use it. So what are some of the things a company can do to make clinical diagnostic testing more accessible for everyone? How can an important medical test be affordable to all?\nOn this episode of Health &amp; Life Sciences at the Edge, host Michelle Dawn Mooney talks with Intel Head of Business Innovation and Life Science Specialist Blake Harlan and SiPhox Chief Product Officer Mike Dubrovsky about clinical diagnostic testing, the way it is used, and the way its use can be improved.\n\u201cClinical diagnostic testing is actually a major part of the [healthcare] system,\u201d says Dubrovsky. \u201cSeventy percent of all medical decisions require diagnostic tests. However, the way that it\u2019s done now is very reactive, so the whole system is based on first the patient having symptoms and then they\u2019re put through a series of tests to try to resolve the problem.\u201d Harlan and Dubrovsky further mention how it\u2019s easy for those in higher income brackets to get tested more often, as those types of tests cost much more than the ones for reactive patients who are presently experiencing symptoms.\nRead more here and here.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n                    \n                                    \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Sign up and get 10% off your first order\n          Sign up to get offers and the latest information on optimizing your health.\n          \n            \n                \n                Sign up\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n          \n                    \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \n                  \n\n\n        \n          \n            Company\n\n                        \n                        SiPhox, Inc.\n111 Terrace Hall Avenue\nBurlington MA 01803 US\nsupport@siphoxhealth.com\n\n                        \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n            Connect with us\n\n                        \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n\n                                    \n            \n                        Disclaimer\n            \n            \n                        \n              \n                The reference ranges and insights presented in the SiPhox Health dashboard are meant to improve readability and provide context, however you should consult with your physician for a more formal interpretation of your results.

Every blood test we conduct is rigorously vetted in labs that boast CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. Furthermore, our clients frequently validate their blood test results against industry giants like Quest and LabCorp, reporting consistent positive correlations (see here, for example). Yet, the realm of clinical lab testing is inherently nuanced, and despite our best efforts, variations can occur.\nThe Precision Paradigm\nGiven that a whopping 70% of medical decisions hinge on lab tests, the stakes for accuracy are high. However, despite our (and others\u2019) best efforts, variance has widely been accepted as commonplace in laboratory testing with lab errors having a reported frequency of 0.012\u20130.6% of all test results. [1]\nAt SiPhox Health, we\u2019re committed to transparency and excellence throughout our product\u2019s development. Our collaboration with CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited labs ensures our tests undergo rigorous validation against traditional venous draws. Despite this, it\u2019s important to recognize the inherent variability within laboratory testing. Instrument variations, calibrator differences among reagent manufacturers, and unique lab reference ranges introduce a degree of variability. Unlike some in the at-home diagnostics field, we openly discuss the limitations of our technology, acknowledging that discrepancies can occur between labs, especially on immunoassay systems. A recognized industry standard accepts up to a 15% variation in results, known as the coefficient of variability, even when analyzing the same blood sample on identical machines. For a detailed look at the acceptable ranges for each analyte, visit this link. State-of-the-art equipment notwithstanding, minor calibration differences or reagent quality issues can lead to variances in outcomes.\nThe challenge of ensuring accurate blood test results is heightened by the use of different blood analyzing machines, such as Beckman or Abbott (the 2 leading diagnostic device manufacturers), which can lead to discrepancies in test outcomes. This article delves into the complexities of lab testing, highlighting the significant role that errors at various stages\u2014before, during, and after analysis\u2014play in affecting the precision of lab tests. Notably, many of these errors occur in the preanalytical phase, before the actual testing begins. The diversity of equipment used across laboratories underscores the difficulty in achieving standardized testing procedures and emphasizes the critical need for ongoing enhancements in lab practices. Our\u00a0openness about these challenges underscores our commitment to quality and the continuous improvement of our services, ensuring we provide reliable and accurate health monitoring solutions.\nSiPhox Liquichek Analysis\nImmunoassays are scientific tests conducted in laboratories to find out how much of a specific substance is present in a fluid, often used to detect levels of biomarkers in the body. The Liquichek Immunoassay Control is a product that clinical labs use to make sure their immunoassay tests are accurate and dependable. These controls have known concentration levels and are used to verify analyzer performance and calibration needs. Ideally, when using different testing machines (analyzers) to measure the same Liquichek control sample, the results should be consistent. However, this method is imperfect and variations do occur.\nSiPhox Health analyzed data from Bio-Rad to see how much results can vary depending on the analyzer used across several Liquichek controls (L1, L2, and L3). We discovered that for some substances, like cortisol and insulin, the measured concentrations are fairly consistent across different analyzers. But for others, like testosterone and vitamin D, the results could vary dramatically, with discrepancies over 300% and 600%, respectively. This means that for these markers, different machines could show results that differ by more than six times, highlighting the challenge of ensuring uniformity in immunoassay testing across different equipment. (Note: the number of data points varies for each biomarker.)\n\n\nHuman Error\nThe inherent nature of at-home self-testing introduces a greater likelihood of human error compared to traditional sample collection methods. Common issues contributing to errors include insufficient sample quantity, contamination, and damaged samples (ex. smeared, hemolyzed), all of which are frequently cited as reasons for discrepancies in test results. To help counteract these potential sources of error, SiPhox Health provides free phlebotomy calls and recommends following specific collection guidelines:\n\n\nCirculation is important. Instead of testing immediately after rolling out of bed, drink some water, wash your hands in warm water to remove potential contaminants, do some light exercises to get the blood going, and ensure that your hands are warm. Collecting your sample while standing up can let gravity do some of the work.\n\nUse proper pricking technique. After wiping the fingertip with alcohol, let the residual disinfectant air-dry for about 30 seconds. If you have callused fingertips, try to find an area on the finger that is softer. Press the lancet down firmly until you hear a click and feel a pinch.\n\nCollecting the sample. Flip the hand over and use your other hand to massage the pricked finger, starting at the knuckle and gently gliding down toward the fingertip until a large drop is formed. Droplets should be large enough to drip off the fingertip. Collect four large drops in one square before moving to the next. Don\u2019t take too long to collect one square since this could lead to poor absorption and serum separation.\n\nTrouble collecting enough blood? SiPhox Health is releasing a patented finger pump!\n\n\n\nShipping the test. Leave the card on the table for 30 minutes to an hour until it is completely dry to avoid smearing. Make sure to register your test, as unregistered tests cannot be analyzed by the lab. Samples are viable for 14 days, so ship them off in a timely manner to accommodate for transportation times.\n\nCapillary Vs Venous\nCapillary sampling has long since been used by the medical profession for those with difficult venous access, such as neonates, having shown a strong correlation with more traditional methods. [2] SiPhox Health is at the vanguard, now utilizing this technology as a less invasive but equally reliable alternative to traditional venous draws, allowing for at-home collection without sacrificing accuracy. Our laboratories have undertaken rigorous validation studies comparing capillary samples directly with venous draws ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our results are upheld.\nUnderstanding Natural Variabilities\nSome biomarkers are subject to natural variation. Understanding these inherent variations is crucial for accurate health assessments. For example:\n\n\nCyclical Biological Patterns: Our hormonal landscape is dynamic, with cortisol and testosterone levels ebbing and flowing with the day\u2019s rhythm. Other hormones such as TSH, estradiol, FSH, progesterone, and LH experience frequent fluctuations as well. [3]\n\n\nInfluences of Daily Living: The rhythms of our daily activities, including dietary habits, physical activity, fasting, and sleep patterns, significantly sway our biomarker levels.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of these natural oscillations, we recommend consistent, periodic testing. A morning fasting test, ideally at a consistent time after waking up with every test, is recommended to standardize results and mitigate daily fluctuations.\nMany biomarkers, including those mentioned, are influenced by daily biological cycles and lifestyle factors. These variables mean that for a truly comparative analysis, simultaneous blood draws across different laboratories would need to be conducted at the same time to detect true result errors.\nFor analytes like Vitamin D and Testosterone that are not commonly measured, there exists a broader industry issue: differing results across laboratories based on the specific instruments used, such as those from Beckman, Abbott, or Roche. This variation underscores a broader industry issue regarding uniformity in testing outcomes.\nAt SiPhox Health, we\u2019ve dedicated ourselves to ensuring our tests\u2019 repeatability and validity, particularly against traditional venous draws. Our extensive internal studies, conducted during our product\u2019s alpha phase, have confirmed that our measurements are consistent and responsive to changes in lifestyle and supplementation. This robust validation process underscores our commitment to providing accurate, reliable health monitoring solutions that reflect the dynamic nature of human biology.\nThe following is data from one of our clients shared with permission illustrating the responsive nature of blood tests to lifestyle events:\n\nData shared from a client with permission\nIn general, some of these measurements work better as serial measurements because one is able to establish a baseline and then see deviations. Right now, doctors rely on single measurements because of logistical issues. In reality, a single measurement of many biomarkers contains a lot of uncertainty because they can change easily.\nEmbracing the Complexity\nAcknowledging these factors doesn\u2019t undermine the value of blood tests; rather, it highlights the importance of context, serial measurements, and choosing reputable labs like SiPhox Health. We\u2019re transparent about the inherent challenges we face and committed to pushing the boundaries for accuracy.\nMoving Forward\nVariability in lab results is a known entity, yet it doesn\u2019t detract from the utility of these tests. Instead, it underscores the need for careful interpretation, consistency in testing conditions, and ongoing technological improvements. SiPhox Health is leading the charge, ensuring that you can access reliable, precise health insights from the comfort of your own home, this year we plan to fully replace our current ADX collection card-based kits with our superior SiPhox Home readers \u2013 the same accurate results with quicker turnaround. Our goal? To empower you with the information you need to make informed health decisions, today and into the future.\n\n&nbsp;\nDisclaimer: If you have any medical questions or concerns, please talk to your healthcare provider.

Understanding its role is key for assessing fertility and reproductive health.\nAbnormal FSH levels can indicate health issues like POI and PCOS in women and testicular damage in men. Its measurement is essential for diagnosing and understanding various reproductive conditions.\nRegular monitoring of FSH levels provides insights into changes in ovarian reserve and sperm production quality. This is crucial for informed decisions regarding fertility and overall reproductive health management.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nFollicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) plays a crucial role in the human body, particularly in the reproductive system. It is produced by the pituitary gland and is involved in sexual development and reproduction for both males and females. In females, FSH stimulates the production of\u00a0estradiol\u00a0and regulates the menstrual cycle, peaking just before ovulation. In males, FSH works with\u00a0testosterone\u00a0to maintain normal sperm count and function. FSH levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, with a peak in levels typically triggering ovulation.\nIn women\u2019s health, FSH is particularly significant. High levels of FSH may indicate conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), perimenopause, ovarian tumor, or Turner syndrome. Low FSH may indicate a pituitary gland disorder, hypothalamus disorder, insufficient egg production, or significant malnutrition. For males, high FSH may indicate testicular damage or Klinefelter syndrome, while low FSH may indicate pituitary gland or hypothalamus disorders. While high or low FSH may indicate certain conditions, FSH alone should not be used for diagnosis. FSH should be used in conjunction with other symptoms, biomarkers, and disease indicators. For these reasons, if you are concerned with your results, it is important to consult with your physician.\nUnderstanding FSH\nFollicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropin, a type of hormone essential for reproductive processes in both females and males. In women, FSH is key to the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles, each containing an egg. It\u2019s released by the pituitary gland and plays a critical role in regulating the menstrual cycle and stimulating the ovaries to produce estrogen. In the context of fertility, FSH levels are inversely indicative of ovarian reserve and function (i.e. high FSH indicates low ovarian reserve), making it crucial for understanding a woman\u2019s fertility potential at different stages of her reproductive life.\nIn men, Follicle-Stimulatin Hormone (FSH) plays a crucial role in reproduction, primarily by regulating the function of the testes. In males, FSH is secreted by the pituitary gland and is instrumental in the development and maturation of sperm. It acts directly on the Sertoli cells in the testes, which are essential for nurturing and supporting the development of sperm cells through the process of spermatogenesis. FSH stimulates these cells to produce and secrete various substances that promote sperm cell growth. Additionally, FSH is involved in increasing the concentration of testosterone-binding protein, which ensures a high local concentration of testosterone \u2013 essential for proper sperm development. This hormone\u2019s activity is closely regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, ensuring that sperm production is maintained at optimal levels for male fertility.\nImportance of Tracking FSH for Females\n\nRepeat testing of FSH levels allows women to track changes over time, providing a clearer picture of their reproductive health and fertility status. Regular monitoring can indicate the onset of changes in ovarian reserve, especially as women age, and assist in making informed decisions about family planning and potential fertility treatments. It\u2019s a valuable tool in understanding and managing reproductive health across different life stages.\nSiPhox Health facilitates this through at-home tests, providing convenient and regular monitoring of FSH levels, and empowering women with valuable information for informed decision-making regarding their reproductive health.\nTypically, a doctor might order an FSH test only once or infrequently, often in response to specific symptoms or concerns. This limited testing can miss fluctuations and trends in FSH levels over time, which are crucial for understanding a woman\u2019s reproductive health and fertility status comprehensively. Regular, long-term tracking provides a more detailed and dynamic picture, allowing for better-informed decisions and timely interventions. This approach is more optimal than relying on single or infrequent tests for understanding and managing reproductive health changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        Research from \u2018Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology\u2019 highlights the predictive value of FSH levels in assessing ovarian function. One key insight is that elevated FSH levels in women, particularly in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, can be a sign of reduced ovarian reserve. This information is crucial for understanding fertility potential and planning for conception.\n\n    \n\n    \n   \n\n\nImportance of Tracking FSH for Males\nAssessing Reproductive Health\nFSH is integral to male reproductive health, primarily because it governs spermatogenesis, the process of sperm production in the testes. In cases of infertility or reduced fertility, measuring FSH levels can provide crucial insights. Low levels of FSH are often linked to a decreased sperm count or poor sperm quality, whereas high levels might suggest a failure in the testicular response. This information is vital for understanding an individual\u2019s reproductive capabilities and planning appropriate interventions or treatments. [1]\nDiagnosing Hormonal Imbalances\nHormonal balance is crucial for overall health, and FSH plays a significant role in this equilibrium. Disorders like hypogonadism, where the body produces insufficient testosterone, can be detected through abnormal FSH levels. Symptoms of hormonal imbalances, such as reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, or changes in physical characteristics, can be distressing. By tracking FSH levels, healthcare providers can diagnose these imbalances early and prescribe suitable treatments to alleviate symptoms and restore hormonal balance. [2]\nEvaluating Testicular Function\nThe health and functionality of the testes are directly reflected in FSH levels. Abnormal readings can indicate various conditions, ranging from testicular atrophy to damage caused by trauma, surgery, or infections. Men who have experienced such issues can benefit significantly from regular FSH monitoring, as it helps in early detection and treatment of potential complications, ensuring better long-term testicular health. [3]\nMonitoring Treatment Response\nFor men undergoing treatments for infertility or hormonal imbalances, monitoring FSH levels is a key part of the therapeutic process. It allows healthcare providers to track how effectively the body is responding to the treatment. Therapy adjustments, whether they involve hormone replacement, surgical interventions, or lifestyle changes, can be guided by changes in FSH levels, leading to more successful outcomes. [4]\nDetecting Underlying Conditions\nElevated FSH levels can sometimes signal issues beyond the reproductive system, such as disorders of the pituitary gland, which regulates the production of various hormones. Conditions like Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting male chromosomes, or varicocele, an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, can also alter FSH levels. Detecting these conditions early can lead to more effective management and treatment. [5]\nGuiding Clinical Decisions\nUnderstanding a patient\u2019s FSH levels helps clinicians make more informed decisions regarding their care. It plays a crucial role in determining the best approach to treatment, be it hormone therapies, surgical interventions, or assisted reproductive techniques like in vitro fertilization (IVF). Additionally, FSH levels provide valuable information for counseling men about their fertility prospects and future family planning options. [6]\nFSH Levels and Pregnancy\n\nOptimal FSH levels for conception typically range from about 4.7 to 21.5 mIU\/mL [7], depending on a woman\u2019s age and the specific phase of her menstrual cycle. Lower FSH levels are generally more favorable for fertility. However, individual factors and health conditions can influence these levels. It\u2019s important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized assessment and guidance.\nEven with higher FSH levels, conception can still be possible, but it may become more challenging. Each woman\u2019s fertility profile is unique, and FSH is just one of many factors influencing it.\nKnowing FSH levels before and after attempting to get pregnant helps in understanding a woman\u2019s fertility window and potential challenges. Pre-pregnancy, it can indicate ovarian reserve and readiness for conception. Post-pregnancy, it aids in monitoring recovery and understanding any changes in fertility, especially in cases of difficulties in conceiving or planning for future pregnancies. This knowledge is vital for informed health decisions and family planning. For personalized advice, consult with a healthcare provider.\n\nFSH and Women\u2019s Age-Related Fertility\nFSH levels naturally vary with age in women. In the reproductive years, FSH levels fluctuate within the menstrual cycle, with a notable increase triggering ovulation. As women approach menopause, their ovarian reserve declines, leading to a significant rise in FSH levels. This increase is a response to decreased estrogen production, as the body attempts to stimulate the ovaries to produce more estrogen. The elevated FSH levels during this phase can be a marker of the transition into menopause. [8]\nAs women approach their late 30s and 40s, FSH levels may start to rise, signaling a decrease in ovarian reserve. This increase becomes more pronounced as women near menopause, typically in their late 40s to 50s, reflecting the diminished estrogen production and reduced fertility. These age-related changes in FSH levels are key indicators of a woman\u2019s reproductive life stage. [9]\nStrategies to Optimize FSH Levels\nLifestyle Changes\nManaging stress through techniques like meditation, yoga, or regular exercise can help regulate hormone levels, including FSH. Adequate sleep is crucial, as disrupted sleep patterns can affect hormonal balance. Avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol consumption is also beneficial, as these can impact FSH levels and overall fertility.\nDietary Changes\nA balanced diet rich in antioxidants can support reproductive health. Foods high in antioxidants, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains, are recommended. Reducing intake of processed foods and maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise is key, as obesity can affect hormone levels.\nSupplement Regimen\n\nTo Lower FSH Levels:\n\nRoyal Jelly: This nutrient-rich substance can help reduce FSH levels.\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in supplements like fish oil, they can assist in regulating hormone levels.\nVitamin D: Essential for hormonal regulation, it can be supplemented or obtained from sun exposure.\nZinc: A crucial mineral for reproductive health, which can aid in hormonal balance.\n\n\nTo Increase FSH Levels:\n\nOyster Polypeptides: Derived from oysters, these supplements may increase FSH levels.\nProbiotics: Supporting gut health, which in turn can impact hormonal balance.\n\n\n\nWhile lifestyle and dietary changes can influence overall health, they may not directly alter FSH levels significantly and should be viewed as part of a broader health strategy. Always follow the advice of your physician when making dietary changes or introducing a new supplement.\nInterpreting your Results\nFemales should take FSH tests on day 3[10]\u00a0of their menstrual cycle. When interpreting results for FSH, it is important to consider how dynamic this hormone can be. In those who menstruate,\u00a0FSH varies considerably between the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Levels increase with age, but a surge occurs during perimenopause (the start of menopause)\u00a0and\u00a0remains high post-menopause. In males,\u00a0FSH is low and is relatively static in comparison.\nThe following graph by\u00a0Straight Healthcare\u00a0shows how variable\u00a0FSH can be for menstruating females, along with other hormones that are important for the regulation of\u00a0the menstrual cycle.\n\nReference Ranges\nTo assist in the interpretation of test results, the\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine\u00a0published reference ranges for FSH:\n\nNormally Menstruating Females:\n\nFollicular phase: 2 \u2013 9 mIU\/mL\nMid-cycle peak: 4 \u2013 22 mIU\/mL\nLuteal phase: 2 \u2013 9 mIU\/mL\n\n\n\n\nPostmenopausal Females:\n\n30 mIU\/mL\n\n\n\n\nMales:\n\n1 \u2013 7 mIU\/mL\n\n\n\nAbnormally high or low levels of FSH\u00a0could\u00a0be indicative of a more serious issue, so please consult with your physician if you are concerned with any of your results.\nConclusion\nAt SiPhox Health, we firmly believe in the power of understanding your body through regular FSH monitoring.

Canadians are thus forced to take extreme measures to receive a reasonable level of care, often leading to financial distress or an insufficient amount of care. Other at-home testing companies have attempted to meet the needs of Canadians, but have been met with logistical challenges or unacceptable costs.\nThe Solution:\nSiPhox Health stood up an extensive Canadian logistical network, enabling us to offer low-cost testing outside of the United States.

We\u2019re fixing that.\n\nThe average American lifespan has plateaued over the last 2 decades\n\nWe believe that every human is unique. Biomarker tracking is required to know whether a particular lifestyle or health intervention is working. At scale, we envision that frequent population biomarker tracking will enable humans to live longer and healthier lives.\nTo enable this future, our team is working to decrease the cost of at-home testing by 10x and make results available immediately.\nSiPhox just launched SiPhox Health, an at-home test kit service that enables users to track 17 health tests ($85\/test)\u00a0\ud83e\ude78\u00a0+ sleep, activity, and heart rate data from your wearable device \u231a in a single dashboard.\u00a0JOIN SIPHOX 10% OFF\nAbout SiPhox\n\nSiPhox was created to empower individuals to take control of their health journey.\nSiPhox is a simple, convenient, low-cost, and comprehensive way to track your health and minimize chronic disease risk.\nWe measure inflammation, metabolic fitness, hormonal + nutritional balance, and cardiovascular health. These are shown in a comprehensive, easy-to-understand wellness dashboard (sample dashboard) with personalized insights so you can track and improve over time.\nFor now, all the tests are done via\u00a0mail-in,\u00a0self-collected samples\u00a0at a\u00a0gold standard CLIA-certified lab, SiPhox hardware will be phased in next year.\nOver the last 3 months, our alpha users discovered and improved things like low Vit. D, high inflammation (hsCRP), low Testosterone, High ApoB\/LDL cholesterol, high fasting Insulin, poor sleep, and more.\nWe want this sort of tracking to be broadly accessible to those that can\u2019t afford concierge medicine.\u00a0At $85\/kit for the monthly membership (before discount) we set the lowest price on the market (compare to $250 for Insidetracker InnerAge 2.0).\n\nUse this link for a 10% discount on your first 3 test kits:\u00a0JOIN SIPHOX\n\n\n\nHow it works\u00a0\u2699\ufe0f\n\nSubscribe to SiPhox\nConnect your wearable devices (8sleep, Fitbit, Whoop, Oura, etc.)\nReceive an at-home collection kit to self-collect a blood sample (see picture above)\nSchedule a guided self-collection meeting with one of our experts if you have never done it before.

It can be silently harmful for years.\nChronically elevated CRP levels are linked to an increased risk for noncommunicable diseases and are now recognized as an active cause of inflammation, not just a marker.\nLifestyle changes, such as improved diet, regular exercise, and quitting smoking, along with certain supplements like curcumin and Omega-3, can effectively lower CRP levels and reduce inflammation.\n\n\n\nWhy Measure Your Inflammation (hs-CRP), and What Does It Mean\nThere are two main types of inflammation. Acute (short-term) and chronic inflammation (long-term, low-level).\nClassically, inflammation is viewed as an acute response to tissue injury, infection, or another disease state that produces characteristic symptoms (swelling, redness, and warmth). In most cases, this is a functional and useful immune response. However, in some cases, the inflammatory system can be operating at a persistently elevated level, which is known as chronic inflammation.\nThe medical community has been aware of chronic inflammation for a long time, but only in recent decades has it become possible to track low levels of inflammation using high-sensitivity blood tests. This has shed light on chronic, systemic inflammation as a highly destructive process that drives disease\u00a0pathogenesis [1]\u00a0and the aging process itself. It contributes so significantly to the deterioration associated with aging that it has been coined \u201cInflammaging.\u201d [2]\nChronic inflammation contributes to the development of at least 7 of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. It may go undetected for years or even decades without proactive tracking, silently threatening your health.\nC-Reactive Protein, or CRP, is used to measure acute inflammation, but with the advent of hsCRP (high-sensitivity CRP) testing, it became possible to use it for tracking chronic\u00a0inflammation as well. CRP is one of several proteins rapidly produced by the liver during an inflammatory response. Its primary goal in acute inflammation is to coat damaged cells and bacteria to make them easier to recognize by other immune cells.\nChronically elevated CRP may signal an increased risk for\u00a0practically all noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), [3] including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, chronic lower respiratory disease, and more \u2013 even if you are asymptomatic. However, conventionally, it is not treated on its own until it occurs in association with another medical condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis.)\nCRP, in recent years, has also become understood as an active cause of inflammation in addition to simply being a marker of inflammation.\nChronically elevated CRP: A Direct Link to Decreased Longevity\nCRP is an immune system protein produced by the liver in response to injury, infection, or other inflammatory events. Physicians often look at CRP as one of the major markers of chronic and acute inflammation.\nMeta-analyses of all-cause mortality studies find that for longevity, the ideal baseline CRP is essentially as low as\u00a0possible. [4]\n\nThis empirical evidence agrees well with aging clocks like the Morgan Levine\u00a0PhenoAge clock, [5] where baseline CRP is a major component, and with leading Inflammaging [6] research.\nChronic inflammation is a\u00a0contributing factor [7]\u00a0to cancer, heart disease, lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. It is also connected to an array of metabolic disorders, including pre-diabetes and diabetes, obesity (animal studies suggest that high levels of CRP may even\u00a0directly cause weight gain [8]by interfering with metabolism), and high blood pressure (CRP causes chronic contraction of blood vessels). [9]\nThis is why tracking and optimizing baseline CRP using high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) tests is just as important for longevity and healthspan as blood glucose tracking (diabetes prevention), and lipid (ApoA1, ApoB, HDL, LDL) tracking (cardiovascular risk reduction).\nHow can I better understand my results?\nThe CDC\/AHA divides the risk of cardiovascular events into the 3 following categories[10]\n\nLow risk: less than 1.0 mg\/L\nAverage risk: 1.0 to 3.0 mg\/L\nHigh risk or acute inflammation: above 3.0 mg\/L (consider discussing with your physician\n\nIt is important to note that research supports targeting baseline CRP levels below 0.5 mg\/dL. Commonly, lab tests will report \u201c&lt;0.2 mg\/L\u201d if you have an ideal\/ undetectable value.\nFor example, a\u00a0study [11] of 27,939 women, showed that hsCRP and cardiovascular risk are proportional, meaning that lower hsCRP was linked to reduced risk\u2014even at the lowest levels measured (&lt;0.5 mg\/L).\nhsCRP vs. CRP\nYou may have seen CRP and hsCRP in your test results. These both refer to the same inflammation protein. CRP, or C-reactive protein, is also called \u201cstandard CRP.\u201d CRP is also used in the diagnosis of severe inflammation related to acute conditions. The standard CPR test measures it in the range of 10 to 1000 mg\/L. An hsCRP or \u201chigh sensitivity CRP\u201d accurately detects lower levels of the protein and is used to evaluate individuals for low-grade inflammation and risk of heart disease. hsCRP measures CRP in the range from 0.2 to 10 mg\/L.\nNote: A high CRP value alone cannot be used to diagnose any specific issue. Consult your physician for any interpretation of your CRP test results.\nWhat are the causes of persistently high baseline CRP?\nShort-term CRP can spike for many reasons including intense exercise, infection, and other factors. Putting those aside, persistently elevated CRP (e.g. above 1mg\/L) can have many underlying causes.\nNearly every common chronic disease has an inflammatory component. Even mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression tend to be\u00a0associated with elevated CRP. [12] As scientists learn more about the brain-body relationship, new connections of this type between blood biomarkers and mental health conditions are being found.\nChronic inflammation can last for months or indefinitely. It can be driven by underlying issues including\u00a0pathogens (like a fungus or parasite), foreign material (such as a toxic chemical), or autoimmune disorders (like IBD or rheumatoid arthritis).\u00a0However, for many modern Americans,\u00a0lifestyle factors [13] such as poor diet, nutritional or hormonal imbalance, cigarette, and alcohol use, and disrupted sleep can be the main driver of long-term inflammation.\nEvidence-Based Approaches to Lowering Baseline CRP\nProactively making an effort to lower CRP levels is both feasible and recommended. Lifestyle has a direct impact on CRP levels. For example, the consumption of trans-fatty acids can increase CRP levels [14] within the 0.9 \u2013 2.3 mg\/L range. Whereas moderate exercise has been shown to be a means\u00a0of\u00a0lowering high CRP. [15]\nBelow are diet, lifestyle, and supplementation protocols that have strong evidence (references included) for improving elevated baseline CRP levels. Note that where possible we generally only reference Randomly Controlled Studies (RCTs) and Meta-analyses of RCTs.\nNote: The information below is provided for reference, please consult your physician before starting any new health regimen.\nEvidence for commonly suggested dietary and lifestyle changes that lower CRP:\n\nImproved sleep\n\n\nComplete and partial sleep deprivation has been shown to increase CRP levels in healthy adults.[16]\n\nSiPhox user data shows a strong -0.46 inverse correlation between the SiPhox sleep score (based on wearable device sleep data) and hsCRP.\nTop SiPhox sleep insight:\n\n\u201cConsider leaving your smartphone and any other screens outside your bedroom before going to bed. This will help you fall asleep faster and improve your sleep efficiency.\u201d\n\nWeight loss (if overweight) and improved diet\n\n\nFollowing a Mediterranean-style diet for a duration of 12 weeks has been shown to decrease CRP levels.[17]\n\nWeight loss is correlated with lowered CRP levels.\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\nMedium-intensity exercise (20 minutes to 1 hour of running) is known to lower your CRP levels[18]\n\nSiPhox user data shows a significant -0.3 inverse correlation between daily steps taken (based on wearable device activity data) and hsCRP.\n\n\nCessation of smoking\n\n\nWhen levels of CRP were compared in smoking status groups for 1926 men aged 40 to 69 years, it was found that long-term cessation brought CRP levels down to non-smoker levels.[19]\n\n\n\nRemoval of processed foods and refined sugars from your diet\n\n\nA low-glycemic index and low glycemic load diet (eating less simple carbohydrates and lower portions of carbs) has been shown to decrease CRP levels.[20]\n\n\n\nHeat Exposure\n\n\nSauna usage [4-7x a week for 10-15 minutes] is associated with decreased hs-CRP levels.[21]\n\n\nEvidence for Commonly Used Supplements for Reducing CRP Levels:\n\nCurcumin\n\n\n(0-3 mg per kilogram of body weight, or roughly 0-1.4 mg per pound.) supplementation is associated with lower CRP levels.[22][23]\n\n\n\nZinc\n\n\nA meta-analysis of 35 Randomized Control studies comprising 1995 participants has displayed a decrease in CRP following Zinc supplementation. [24]\n\n\n\nVitamin D\n\n\nIncreasing sun exposure (15-20 minutes a day) or supplementing with Vitamin D over the counter may increase your Vitamin D levels and increase your Inflammation Score.[25]\n\n\n\nOmega 3\n\n\nOmega 3 or fatty fish consumption is associated with lower CRP levels.[26]\n\n\n\nProbiotic\n\n\nProbiotic supplementation has been shown to decrease CRP levels in a meta-analysis of 31 studies.[27]\n\n\n\nVitamin E (alpha-tocopherol)\n\n\nSupplementing vitamin E (15mg\/day) can lower inflammation. A meta-analysis of 246 participants suggests that supplementation with vitamin E in the form of either \u03b1-tocopherol or \u03b3-tocopherol would reduce serum CRP levels.[28]\n\n\n\nQuercetin\n\n\nSupplementing quercetin at doses above 500 mg\/day can lower inflammation levels. This meta-analysis showed a significant effect of quercetin supplementation on the C-reactive protein-especially at doses above 500 mg\/day and in patients with CRP &lt;3 mg\/l.[29]\n\n\nNote: All of the lifestyle, diet and supplementation approaches to lowering chronic inflammation have been shown to work for the\u00a0average person.\u00a0To know which ones work for you, tracking your hsCRP on a regular basis is the most effective approach.\nTracking your hsCRP with SiPhox Health:\n\nAt-home kit delivered to your home\nFingerprick sample self-collection (low-pain, adjustable lancets)\n$295 one-time or subscribe to get $85 per test*\nNumber of biomarkers included: 17 (4 inflammation markers including hsCRP)\nSleep and activity tracking: Included, 200 devices supported\n2-5 business days after collection\n\nRevolutionizing hsCRP tracking:\nSiPhox Health is developing next-generation at-home testing hardware that will deliver biomarker results, including hsCRP, in under 10 minutes using only 5 microliters of blood, similar to a glucometer.

The liver produces the cholesterol required by the body, and it can also be obtained through diet, mainly from animal products. Cholesterol travels through the bloodstream, attached to proteins. These cholesterol-protein units are called lipoproteins.\nUnderstanding HDL, LDL, and Triglycerides\nCommon cholesterol panels measure three types of lipids in your blood: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Here\u2019s what each of these lipids does:\n\nHDL cholesterol: HDL is often referred to as the \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d because it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and protects against cardiovascular diseases. Higher levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with a lower risk of heart disease.\nLDL cholesterol: LDL is commonly referred to as the \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d because it contributes to the buildup of fatty deposits or plaques in the arteries. High levels of LDL cholesterol increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart disease.\nTriglycerides: Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. They are used by the body for energy, but high levels can contribute to the hardening and narrowing of arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease.\n\nWhy measure Cholesterol levels\nMeasuring cholesterol levels is essential because high cholesterol can lead to the buildup of fatty deposits or plaques in the arteries. This increases the risk of age-related conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, and heart disease. Regular cholesterol testing helps assess heart health, estimate the risk of cardiovascular disease, and monitor the impact of lifestyle changes on cholesterol levels.\nWhat are the risks of high\/low Cholesterol? A link to longevity\nHigh cholesterol, specifically high levels of LDL cholesterol, increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart disease. On the other hand, high levels of HDL cholesterol protect against cardiovascular diseases.\nLow levels of HDL cholesterol may increase the risk of heart disease and premature death. Extremely low levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are not associated with any health risks but may indicate an underlying medical condition.\nSeveral studies have shown that maintaining optimal cholesterol levels can contribute to a longer and healthier life, while high cholesterol levels can lead to a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases and reduced life expectancy.\nInterpretation of Cholesterol test results and optimal ranges\nCholesterol test results provide insights into an individual\u2019s risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. The optimal ranges for cholesterol and triglycerides are as follows:\n\nTotal cholesterol: 125-200 mg\/dL\nLDL cholesterol: &lt;130 mg\/dL\nHDL cholesterol: &gt;45 mg\/dL for men; &gt;55 mg\/dL for women\nTriglycerides: &lt;150 mg\/dL\n\nReaching and maintaining optimal cholesterol levels could potentially add decades to one\u2019s life.\nDiet\nEating Heart-Healthy Foods plays a significant role in managing cholesterol levels.\n\nReduce Saturated and Trans Fats: Saturated fats found in red meat and dairy products increase total cholesterol. Worse still, trans fats \u2014 often labeled as \u201cpartially hydrogenated oils\u201d in store-bought cookies, crackers, and cakes \u2014 can raise your LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels.\nIncrease Soluble Fiber: Foods rich in soluble fiber can lower your LDL cholesterol. Good sources include oatmeal, kidney beans, brussels sprouts, apples, and pears.\nAdd Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids can boost HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart disease. Salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Flaxseeds and walnuts also offer these beneficial fats.\nReduce Sugar Consumption: The consumption of sugar (sucrose, high fructose corn syrup) increases plasma levels of triglycerides, LDL and apoB, and reduces plasma levels of HDL-C and apoA. The removal of sugar reverses each of these.\n\nBehavioral Change\n\nQuit Smoking: Quitting smoking improves your HDL cholesterol levels. Moreover, the benefits happen quickly: Within 20 minutes of quitting, your blood pressure and heart rate decrease.\nReduce Alcohol Intake: While moderate alcohol use has been linked with higher levels of HDL cholesterol, the benefits aren\u2019t strong enough to recommend alcohol for anyone who doesn\u2019t drink already. Too much alcohol can lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, heart failure, and strokes.\n\nDietary Supplements\nSupplements may play a role in helping you to optimize cholesterol, however, make sure to discuss this with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen.\n\nPlant sterols and stanols.\nsoluble fiber (psyllium).\nomega-3 fatty acids.\ncoenzyme Q10.\n\nExercise\nModerate and High-Intensity Cardio has been shown to be the most effective form of exercise to improve HDL function and overall lipid profile.\nConsistent Testing\n\nIdentification of Baseline Levels: The first step in managing cholesterol is to know your starting point. This initial test, such as the SiPhox Health Panel, provides the baseline for future tests, allowing you and your doctor to track changes over time.\nEarly Detection of Potential Issues: Regular blood testing can catch elevated cholesterol levels before they lead to health issues such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or heart disease. By identifying these changes early, you can take proactive measures to lower your cholesterol and reduce your risk.\nMonitoring the Effectiveness of Interventions: If you\u2019re making lifestyle changes or taking medication to manage cholesterol, regular blood testing can show whether these strategies are working. If your cholesterol levels aren\u2019t improving, or if they\u2019re getting worse, you may need to adjust your strategies.\n\nWhat do the experts say?\nDr. Robert H. Eckel- former President of the American Heart Association\n\n\u201cLDL cholesterol is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The optimal LDL cholesterol level is less than 100 mg\/dL for most people. However, for those at higher risk, such as those with a history of heart disease or diabetes, an LDL level of less than 70 mg\/dL is often recommended\u201d\n\nDr. Patrick Moriarty- Director of the Atherosclerosis and LDL-Apheresis Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center\n\n\u201cWhile focusing on lowering LDL cholesterol, we shouldn\u2019t neglect HDL, or \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol. For men, an HDL level of 40 mg\/dL or higher is protective against heart disease, while for women, it should be 50 mg\/dL or higher\u201d\n\nDr. Peter Attia- Founder, Early Medical\n\n\u201cIf you want to stop atherosclerosis, you must lower the LDL particle number.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\nTracking your Cholesterol with SiPhox Health:\n\nAt-home kit delivered to your home\nFingerprick sample self-collection (low-pain, adjustable lancets)\n$295 one-time or subscribe to get $85 per test*\nNumber of biomarkers included: 17 (6 cardiovascular markers including LDL, HDL, ApoA, ApoB, triglycerides, etc.)\nSleep and activity tracking: Included, 200 devices supported\n2-5 business days after collection\n\n\n    \n        \n            Start your SiPhox Health journey\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Home health testing has never been this good\n        \n    \n    Subscribe to SiPhox and start tracking your LDL + 16 other critical biomarkers as well as sleep, activity and heart data all in one comprehensive dashboard.\n\n    Get started\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nDisclaimer: If you have any medical questions or concerns, please talk to your healthcare provider.

See below for a great demonstration video from MIT, complete with a proper analog demo:\n\nToday we have extremely large interferometers like LIGO, the gravitational wave detector, and microscale interferometers that can be fabricated in the thousands on a chip the size of the head of a pin.\n\nLIGO gravitational wave interferometer.\nDue to constructive and destructive interference, certain wavelengths of light pass through a resonant cavity while others do not. The wavelengths that pass through the cavity are called resonance wavelengths, and when the optical path length in the cavity changes, these resonance wavelengths will also change.\n\nNote that the optical path length can be altered either by physically stretching or shrinking the path the light takes (which is what happens when gravity waves pass through the LIGO detector arms), or by changing the refractive index of the matter through which the light passes. Because the wavelength of light is on the order of 1 micron, or 1 millionth of a meter, even a tiny change in the optical path length changes the amount of transmitted light at a given wavelength.\nMicro Ring Resonators\n\nSilicon micro ring resonator (20 micron radius).[1]\nThe high sensitivity of optical cavities to the wavelength of incident light is widely used to create optical filters for fiber optic communications. When optical components began to follow the trend of chip-scale miniaturization, silicon micro ring resonators (MRRs) based on silicon nanowire waveguides became workhorse components of optical chips. See here for a basic explanation of total internal reflection and waveguides:\n\nAs seen in the electron microscope image above, a ring resonator is a looped silicon waveguide coupled to a straight waveguide. As light couples into the looped waveguide and back out again, it can accumulate exactly the right amount of phase to generate destructive interference in the straight waveguide\u2019s output (see GIF below).\n\nElectrical field in micro ring resonator at the resonance wavelength[2]\nThis results in an effect where some frequencies of light traveling in the straight waveguide are filtered out as they pass the ring. More on this in the next section. An excellent review of micro ring resonator theory can be found here: W. Bogaerts et. al\nThe working principle of MRR biosensors\nThe optical spectrum of a typical micro ring resonator is shown below (with periodic dips at the resonant wavelengths of light):\n\nThe distance between these periodic dips in a MRR\u2019s spectrum depends on the ring\u2019s overall optical path length (the longer the ring, the more wavelengths within a certain span fit into the ring an integer number of times, meaning there are more resonances), and changes gradually as the length of the ring is varied. However, the absolute position of the dips is highly sensitive to tiny changes in the refractive index of the ring. This is because light slows down when it passes through higher index material. For example, light is 30% slower in water than in air. If the light of a certain frequency circulating in the micro ring takes slightly more or less time to perform a full loop, it will no longer be at the correct phase to create destructive interference. The upshot is that a slightly higher refractive index causes the entire set of dips to shift to the right, and a slightly lower one causes them to shift to the left.\n\nLeft: Cross-section of a silicon waveguide with optical intensity Right: Schematic of resonance shift due to particle attachment to the waveguide surface\nAs light travels through the silicon nanowire, about 30% of it interacts with what is called \u201cthe cladding.\u201d The cladding is a low index medium like glass, air, or water, that leads to total internal reflection at the interface with the silicon waveguide. In telecom applications, a glass cladding is typically used, but to build a biosensor, the glass cladding over the micro ring is intentionally omitted (in reality it is etched away after deposition).\nThis allows the ring to be exposed to liquid samples. And as analyte molecules bind to the surface of the waveguide, the spectrum of the ring shifts to the right:\n\nOptical spectrum of a micro ring resonator red shifting due to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein attaching to the waveguide surface.\nThe sensitivity of MRR sensors comes from the optics (and they can be sensitive down to detecting a single nanoparticle), but the specificity comes from the surface chemistry. Surface capture proteins (e.g. antibodies) are typically attached to the sensor in order to make it specifically capture a certain target. For example, attaching anti-spike antibodies to the MRR surface makes it sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 viruses. By printing different proteins, DNA probes, or other chemistries onto different rings, it\u2019s possible to detect a large number of analytes in a tiny sample. Each ring can be as small as ~5 microns in radius (the minimum bend radius that doesn\u2019t allow light to leak out of the sides of a silicon waveguide), meaning that thousands can fit into a square millimeter. See the GIF above for real-time data from the detection of COVID nucleocapsid protein with a micro ring.\nScalability Matters\nThere are many highly sensitive optical approaches (such as various ELISAs and molecular assays based on fluorescence and chemiluminescence) to detect proteins and nucleic acids. What makes silicon micro ring biosensors unique is their scalability and low cost. By using a sensor that is compatible with production in standard large-scale semiconductor fabs (silicon photonics products are made in the millions for the telecom and datacom industries), it\u2019s possible to build a massive amount of tests in a very short time, at very low cost.\nA rough breakdown:\nEach 12-inch SOI wafer can produce 70,000 square-mm chips.\nIndividual MRR biosensors occupy at most .01 square-mm, meaning that a 1 mm * 1 mm chip can have dozens or even hundreds of individual sensors.\n\nA single semiconductor fab can produce up to 100,000 wafers a month.\u00a0Note that this is 100,000 full semiconductor process wafers. MRR sensor chips only require a small subset of the process steps used for typical chips, meaning that capacity for producing sensors is actually much higher.\nThis means that 7 Billion sensor chips can be produced at a single semiconductor fab each month at a cost that could be as low as 25 cents per chip.\nSiPhox\nWe\u2019re hard at work commercializing SiPhox Home,\u00a0a versatile handheld at-home diagnostics platform.

Though not a substitute for your annual bloodwork, SiPhox Health serves as an essential adjunct, providing deeper insights into your health. Perfect for anyone navigating lifestyle changes, new medications, or monitoring chronic conditions, tracking your health has never been easier or more insightful.\nSiPhox Health vs Standard Yearly Blood Test\n\n\nWhat exactly does the standard yearly blood test include?\n\n\nComplete blood count (CBC)\u00a0\u2014 Measures different cells and parts of your blood, which can help detect infections, anemia, blood clots, immune system disorders, and blood cancers.\n\nChemistry panel (complete metabolic panel)\u00a0\u2014 Provides information about your bones, muscles, and other organs.\n\n\nCalcium [1]\u00a0is essential for nerve, muscle, and heart function.\n\nSodium, [2] potassium, [3] carbon dioxide, [4] and chloride [5]\u00a0are electrolytes that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body.\n\nAlbumin\u00a0[6] is a protein that carries hormones, vitamins, and enzymes throughout the body.\nTotal protein\n\nALP (alkaline phosphatase), [7] ALT (alanine transaminase), [8] and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) [9] are different enzymes made by the liver and are used to detect liver dysfunction.\n\n\nBilirubin\u00a0[10] is a waste product made by the liver. High levels are indicative of liver dysfunction.\n\n\nBUN (blood urea nitrogen)\u00a0[11]\u00a0and\u00a0creatinine\u00a0[12] are waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys. If the kidneys are not functioning properly, BUN and creatinine levels will be high.\n\n\n\n\nLipid panel (cholesterol test)\u00a0\u2014 Measures cholesterol-carrying proteins which can help determine cardiovascular risk.\n\nLipids include\u00a0cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).\n\n\n\nBlood sugar screen\u00a0\u2014 Helps in the process of diagnosing diabetes.\n\nHbA1c and fasting glucose\n\n\n\nThyroid health\n\nTSH, Free T3, Free T4\n\n\n\nMicronutrients\n\nB12, Vitamin D, minerals\n\n\n\nThough there is overlap with the standard yearly blood test, there are a few essential markers that SiPhox Health does not measure.\n\nWhich essential markers SiPhox Health does not measure:\n\nKidney function tests (BUN and Creatinine)\nLiver function tests (ALT, AST, ASP)\nCBC\nSome Micronutrients\n\n\n\nWhat biomarkers does SiPhox Health measure?\nSiPhox Health focuses on four key branches of health:\n\n\nCardiovascular Health impacts lifespan and day-to-day vitality. Monitoring your heart and vasculature helps to determine risk factors for heart disease and stroke. SiPhox Health goes beyond traditional cholesterol testing with ApoA1 and ApoB measurements, offering a more detailed assessment of lipid-related cardiovascular risk.\n\nMetabolic Fitness shows how your body processes energy, prevents chronic diseases, manages weight, and boosts energy levels. By measuring markers like HbA1c, Insulin, and thyroid function, SiPhox Health provides a broader understanding of metabolic function and associated risks.\n\nInflammation is your body\u2019s silent alarm system, often reflecting underlying health issues before they become serious. Beyond standard CRP, SiPhox Health tests for hs-CRP, Ferritin, and Homocysteine, providing a more detailed view of inflammation, a key factor in chronic diseases.\n\nHormonal and Nutritional Balance affect various bodily functions including metabolism, mood, growth, immune function, disease risk, and overall wellness. Our panel extends to hormones like Cortisol, DHEA-S, FSH, Estradiol, and Testosterone, vital for understanding physiological stress responses, and overall hormonal balance.\n\nSiPhox Health vs Standard Yearly Blood Test\n\nTo learn more about these biomarkers including why they are important, whether they are included in the standard yearly blood test, how long they take to change with lifestyle modification, and much more, visit: https:\/\/home.siphoxhealth.com\/what-we-measure.\nThe Scientific Benefits of SiPhox Health include:\n\n\nEnhanced Frequency:\u00a0Our regular testing can detect health marker changes more swiftly than annual screenings.\n\nConvenience and Comfort:\u00a0The ease of SiPhox Health\u2019s at-home testing eliminates the need for scheduling clinic visits and enduring long waits.\n\nHealth Data:\u00a0SiPhox Health reports provide insights tailored to individual health profiles, enabling more informed healthcare decisions.\n\nEarly Detection and Prevention:\u00a0The comprehensive nature of our testing facilitates the early detection of potential health issues, allowing for timely intervention.\n\nData-Driven Lifestyle Adjustments:\u00a0With a more detailed health profile, individuals can adjust their lifestyle choices more precisely to match their health needs.\n\nWhat\u2019s included with a SiPhox Health test panel:\n\n\nAt-Home Convenience:\u00a0Our kit comes to your door.

The lower your hs-CRP, the better.\nWhy is hsCRP important?\nSiPhox Health\u2018s hs-CRP test can quantify CRP at extremely small concentrations than standard CRP tests, helping to identify a low but persistent presence of inflammation in your body. This can be an indicator of chronic inflammation types related to cardiovascular or autoimmune illnesses.\nHow can I better understand my hsCRP levels?\nThe\u00a0American Heart Association\u00a0identified that\u00a0males, older adults, and certain ethnicities among other lifestyle factors are at risk of having higher hs-CRP levels.\u00a0\nTo better interpret your results, the following values can be used to gauge the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is important to note that since hs-CRP is a general marker of inflammation, even a simple illness such as the common cold can increase your levels above 10 mg\/L, so it is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned with your levels.\n\n\nHealthy: &lt; 1.0 mg\/L\n\nSlightly high: 1-1.5 mg\/L\n\nModerate\u00a0risk: 1.0 to\u00a010 mg\/L\n\nHigh risk: &gt; 10 mg\/L\nCritical: &gt; 50 mg\/L\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: \u2264 0.75 mg\/L\nGood: .76-1.4 mg\/L\nFair: 1.5-1.99 mg\/L\nPay attention: \u22652 mg\/L\n\nLevels up to 1.0 mg\/L are considered normal but may indicate minor elevation caused by obesity, pregnancy, depression, sedentary lifestyle, and common illnesses. Moderate elevation can indicate the presence of autoimmune disease or cardiovascular events such as a myocardial infarction. High risk is indicative of an infection or trauma and it is advisable to see a doctor.\nHow can I maintain optimal hsCRP levels?\nLuckily, some lifestyle interventions can lower hs-CRP levels.\nDietary Changes: Eating\u00a0anti-inflammatory foods like\u00a0tart cherry juice\u00a0(see a list\u00a0here of what to eat and what to avoid) and following a Mediterranean\u00a0or\u00a0DASH diet can help lower hsCRP levels.\nLifestyle Changes: Staying\u00a0physically fit, quitting smoking, practicing better\u00a0oral hygiene, hopping into a sauna at least 2-3 times per week, and taking a vacation can all help to lower hsCRP levels.\nSupplementation:\u00a0Supplementing with\u00a0curcumin,\u00a0magnesium,\u00a0omega-3, and\/or\u00a0vitamin D can all improve hsCRP levels.

High homocysteine\u00a0levels are associated with elevated cardiovascular risk including coronary artery disease, heart attacks, blood clots, or strokes, and neurological disorders such as dementia.\nWhy is homocysteine important?\nHomocysteine can elevate cardiovascular risk through a mechanism that activates monocytes, a type of immune cell that promotes an inflammatory response. Thus, higher homocysteine levels are linked to increased inflammation. SiPhox Health includes homocysteine in our foundation panel to help monitor and manage homocysteine levels.\nHow can I better understand my results?\nTo assist in interpreting results, the\u00a0American Heart Association\u00a0outlined ranges that indicate normal levels of fasting plasma homocysteine in addition to moderate, intermediate, and severe hyperhomocysteinemia.\n\n\nLow: &lt;5 umol\/L\n\nOptimal: 5-9 umol\/L\n\nNormal: 5-15 umol\/L\n\nModerate: 16-30 umol\/L\n\nIntermediate: 31-100 umol\/L\n\nSevere: &gt;100 umol\/L\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: &lt;4 umol\/L\nGood: 4-5.9 umol\/L\nFair: 6-9.9 umol\/L\nPay attention: 10-14.9 umol\/L\nAlert: &gt;15 umol\/L\n\nHigh levels of homocysteine may be caused by low levels of B vitamins and\/or folate, aging, excessive alcohol use, smoking, thyroid or kidney diseases, medications, or genetic diseases.

Normal levels\u00a0are essential for an effective immune system and healthy mineral balance.\u00a0Vitamin D is vital for its role in calcium absorption, bone mineralization, and reducing inflammation, and even has neuromuscular and metabolic functions.\nWhy is vitamin D important?\nEvidence has shown that low concentrations of vitamin D are associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers\u00a0and an increased risk of\u00a0Metabolic Syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\nHow can I better understand my vitamin D levels?\nThe\u00a0National Library of Medicine has linked several vitamin D levels with different health statuses. While these concentrations may help you interpret your results, it is important to consult with your physician if you have any concerns.\n\nDeficiency: &lt;25 ng\/mL\nInsufficient: 25-40 ng\/mL\nSufficient: 40-70 ng\/mL\nHigh: 70-100 ng\/mL\nCritical: &gt; 100 ng\/mL\n\nLower levels have several health implications. It may lead to decreased bone health, muscular atrophy, and even more serious health problems depending on the levels such as rickets or osteomalacia. People at risk of deficiency are those who follow a vegan diet, do not get enough ultraviolet sun exposure, are obese, have undergone gastric bypass surgery, or have a disease such as IBD, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn\u2019s that disrupts the normal digestion of fat.\nHigher levels can also be harmful, as it could lead to nausea, dehydration, kidney issues, and\u00a0in severe cases\u00a0anorexia, irregular heartbeat, or hardening of blood vessels and tissues.\nHow can I maintain optimal vitamin D levels?\nIf your vitamin D levels are low, you can try:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Eating fatty fish like cod, herring, salmon, swordfish, trout, mackerel, or tuna can help to increase vitamin D levels. Additionally,\u00a0fortified foods such as orange juice, cereal, or milk can help as well.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Spending 15-20 minutes outside between 10 am and 3 pm without sunscreen can help you maintain healthy vitamin D levels, or you can try a\u00a0UV lamp to naturally synthesize more vitamin D without the sun. Additionally, exercise can help to release the vitamin D sequestered in fat.\nSupplementation: Try taking a 600 IU vitamin D supplement which is the recommended dietary intake.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nHarvard T.H.

As such, the ferritin measurement gives us an indirect measurement of your body\u2019s iron stores. Low levels of ferritin may\u00a0indicate\u00a0depletion of iron stores (mild iron deficiency), iron-deficiency erythropoiesis (low red blood cell count),\u00a0or iron deficiency anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit). Anemia is the\u00a0most prevalent nutritional deficiency\u00a0worldwide.\nWhy is ferritin important?\nIron is an important indicator of physiological health as it is extensively used in energy production and oxygen transport in the blood.\u00a0Ferritin levels that are out of range can point to a variety of\u00a0complications\u00a0such as fatigue, headaches, restless legs syndrome, heart problems, pregnancy complications, and developmental delays in children.\u00a0In addition, people with iron deficiency anemia are more likely to have weaker immune responses, gastrointestinal\u00a0upset, problems with concentration and memory, and are less able to work, exercise, and control\u00a0body temperature.\u00a0As\u00a0women are especially susceptible\u00a0to low levels of iron, this test is\u00a0particularly\u00a0important for women\u2019s general health. Heme iron (found in\u00a0meat) is more bioavailable than nonheme iron (found in plants and fortified foods), so\u00a0vegetarians are more prone to\u00a0having depleted iron stores\u00a0as well.\nHow can I better understand my ferritin levels?\nStandard lab ranges for ferritin are currently quite broad. For example, the following are considered normal ranges according to:\n\nMayo Clinic: 24-336 ng\/mL for males and 11-307 ng\/mL for\u00a0females\nCleveland Clinic: 30.4-565.7 ng\/mL for males and 14.7-205.1 ng\/mL for females\nUCSF Health: 12-300 ng\/mL for males and 12-150 ng\/mL for females\n\nConsidering the link between\u00a0ferritin and inflammation, as well as findings that levels under 50 ng\/mL are associated with\u00a0fatigue\u00a0and above 150 ng\/mL may indicate\u00a0iron overload, SiPhox Health utilizes a more conservative optimal range between 50 ng\/mL and 150 ng\/mL.\nAs explained in\u00a0Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology, while many laboratories consider serum ferritin levels &gt; 200 ng\/mL in females and &gt; 300 ng\/mL in males to be abnormal, these levels are common among the general population, likely due to the prevalence of obesity and fatty liver.\nAbnormally low levels of ferritin may indicate\u00a0iron deficiency\u00a0at &lt; 30 ng\/mL and\u00a0iron deficiency anemia\u00a0at &lt; 10 ng\/mL.\nIt is important to\u00a0note\u00a0that serum ferritin\u00a0levels may be elevated in the presence of the following conditions:\n\ninflammation\nsignificant tissue destruction\nliver disease\nmalignancies such as acute\u00a0leukemia and Hodgkin\u2019s disease\n\nPregnant women, menstruating women, frequent blood donors, and people with cancer, gastrointestinal problems, and heart failure are\u00a0most likely to have inadequate iron levels.\nHow can I maintain optimal ferritin levels?\nIf you have low ferritin (&lt; 50 ng\/mL), a few lifestyle modifications to try include:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Supplementing or consuming more iron (fortified cereals, oysters, lentils, etc.) alongside vitamin C (oranges, strawberries, tomatoes, etc.) can help to enhance iron absorption. Additionally,\u00a0limit foods\u00a0containing phytates, polyphenols, and high calcium that inhibit iron absorption (tea, coffee, red wine, calcium supplements) when consuming iron.

For this reason, HbA1c tests\u00a0can also be referred to as glycosylated (sugar-coated) hemoglobin tests.\nWhy is HbA1C important?\nHemoglobin A1C is an important screen for diabetic risk, providing a long-term snapshot of blood glucose concentration in comparison to other tests. Levels that are consistently\u00a0above 5.6%\u00a0may warrant a visit to a physician.

After eating, insulin is released to\u00a0initiate the usage and storage of glucose.\u00a0\nWhy is fasting insulin important?\nAccording to the\u00a0CDC, about 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes, and about 1 in 5 people with diabetes don\u2019t know they have it! High insulin levels can be a leading indicator of pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\u00a0Type\u00a01 diabetes\u00a0is an autoimmune disease caused by\u00a0insufficient production of insulin by the pancreas, whereas\u00a0type 2 diabetes\u00a0is a metabolic disease caused by insulin resistance to high levels of circulating glucose.\u00a0Gestational diabetes\u00a0is\u00a0another type that develops\u00a0in pregnant women and can have negative implications for\u00a0the health of the baby. While insulin is a necessary data point for those with diabetes, it is also very useful for users without these concerns. Insulin levels can serve as a great indicator of your body\u2019s reaction to your current diet and lifestyle. Because of its significance to metabolic health, insulin is included in\u00a0SiPhox Health\u2018s base panel.\nHow can I better understand my insulin levels?\nInsulin follows a natural\u00a0circadian rhythm,\u00a0so sticking to a\u00a0routine (e.g. eating at the same time every day) can help maintain optimal metabolic levels throughout the day.\nMake sure your insulin levels\u00a0are within the recommended\u00a0range\u00a0if you take your test without fasting. We recommend you test in a fasted state (no food or beverages besides water for 8 hours prior to testing). \nWhen\u00a0fasting, you can expect the following insulin levels:\n\nLow: &lt;1.9 uIU\/mL\n\n\nOptimal:\u00a01.9-8\u00a0uIU\/mL\n\n\nHigh: 8-23 uIU\/mL\n\nVery high: &gt;23 uIU\/mL\n\n\nFasting insulin levels that are higher than normal can be indicative of insulin resistance.\u00a0Insulin resistance\u00a0is when the body fails to respond to insulin by taking up glucose, so\u00a0more\u00a0insulin\u00a0is secreted to compensate. Due to the natural rise and fall of insulin throughout the day in anticipation of food, the time of day and your fasting state can influence results. Consult with your physician if you are concerned about your insulin levels.\u00a0\nSymptoms\u00a0of insulin resistance include:\n\nIncreased thirst\nFrequent urination\nIncreased hunger\nBlurred vision or eye changes\nHeadaches\nVaginal and skin infections\nSlow-healing cuts and sores\nDarkened skin in your armpit, back, or sides of your neck (acanthosis nigricans)\nSkin tags\n\nHow can I maintain optimal insulin levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your insulin levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Avoid highly processed, high-carbohydrate foods and saturated fats and opt for low glycemic index foods (beans and legumes, non-starchy veggies, berries, etc.) to lower insulin levels.\nLifestyle Changes: Try exercising and losing weight by leading a healthy lifestyle to regulate insulin levels.\nHormonal disorders such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, and genetic disorders can cause insulin resistance.

It is calculated by\u00a0dividing your\u00a0triglyceride\u00a0level by your\u00a0HDL-C\u00a0level.\nWhy is the TG:HDL-C ratio important?\nIn recent studies, a high TG:HDL-C\u00a0ratio has been shown to predict\u00a0metabolic syndrome,\u00a0diabetes, and\u00a0all-cause mortality.

Having proper levels of testosterone is essential not only for males but for females, too. An imbalance of testosterone can have negative effects on both reproductive and overall health.\nWhile testosterone is a hormone primarily associated with male development and reproductive function, it is also present in females.\u00a0In women, testosterone plays a role in maintaining muscle mass, bone density, libido, and overall well-being.\nWhy is testosterone important?\nSiPhox Health includes testosterone in our Foundation Panel for men and Fertility+ Panel for women to help monitor and manage testosterone levels. In men, testosterone\u00a0regulates sex drive (libido), bone mass, fat distribution, muscle mass and strength, and the production of red blood cells and sperm.\u00a0Symptoms of low testosterone\u00a0may include reduced sex drive, erectile dysfunction, low sperm count, and other emotional and physiological changes.\u00a0\nWhile testosterone levels are typically much lower in females compared to males, they still play a vital role in various\u00a0physiological processes. Fluctuations or abnormalities in female testosterone levels can impact reproductive health, sexual function, mood, and overall health.\u00a0Testosterone is essential for maintaining optimal health and well-being in females. Proper testosterone levels contribute to reproductive health, libido, muscle strength, bone density, mood regulation, and overall vitality.\nHow can I better understand my testosterone levels?\nFree and total testosterone are two different measurements. Total testosterone quantifies, as the name suggests, the overall quantity of testosterone including molecules that are both free (unbound) and bound to proteins (mainly\u00a0SHBG\u00a0and\u00a0albumin). On the other hand, a measure of free testosterone does not measure molecules that are bound to proteins. This is an important measurement as free testosterone is generally more bioactive than bound testosterone. People who may be experiencing symptoms of low testosterone but have normal levels of total testosterone may be advised to take a free testosterone test.\nMales:\nFree and total testosterone ranges vary based on many factors, including age. The\u00a0Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital\u00a0released a list of normal free and total testosterone ranges in males by age.\nNormal total testosterone in males:\n\nAge 20-49: 3.0 \u2013 10.8 ng\/mL\nAge 40-60:\u00a03.0 \u2013 8.9 ng\/mL\nAge 60+:\u00a03.0 \u2013 7.2 ng\/mL\n\nNormal free testosterone in males:\n\nAge 18+:\u00a00.047 \u2013 0.244 ng\/mL\n\nAccording to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic, the\u00a0American Urology Association (AUA) considers low total testosterone to be &lt; 3.0 ng\/mL for adult males. However, some researchers and healthcare providers believe that no more than 2.50 ng\/mL should be indicative of low testosterone.\nTestosterone, like many hormones, follows a\u00a0diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning and dipping in the early evening. Peak secretion occurs between 7 and 10 a.m., which is why\u00a0testing testosterone levels in the morning helps to limit variations, particularly in younger men.\n\nPrinz, Patricia &amp; Bremner, William &amp; Vitiello, Michael. (1983). Loss of Circadian Rhythmicity in Blood Testosterone Levels with Aging in Normal Men*. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 56. 10.1210\/jcem-56-6-1278.\nLow testosterone\u00a0is more likely to affect those who are older, obese, have type 2 diabetes or HIV\/AIDS, have sleep apnea, or have chronic conditions such as kidney or liver dysfunction. Since abnormally high or low testosterone levels may indicate problems with the testicles, pituitary gland, or hypothalamus, it is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned about your levels.\nFemales:\nAccording to the American Board of Internal Medicine:\nNormal serum testosterone levels in females\n\n0.18 \u2013 0.54 ng\/mL.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that different labs have slight variations on the normal reference range.\nHigher than normal testosterone levels in females, known as\u00a0hyperandrogenism, may indicate conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), adrenal disorders, ovarian tumors, or certain medications. Further evaluation, including additional tests and medical history assessment, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause. Lower than normal testosterone levels in females may result from conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency (early menopause), adrenal insufficiency, pituitary disorders, or certain medications. Additional testing and medical evaluation are essential to identify the underlying cause and determine appropriate management.\nHow can I maintain optimal testosterone levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your testosterone levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Consuming fenugreek seed extract, ashwagandha roots and leaves, or\u00a0honey can help to increase lower testosterone levels. Additionally, research suggests that\u00a0macronutrient, vitamin, and mineral\u00a0intake can impact testosterone synthesis.\u00a0Adequate zinc intake, for example, has been shown to regulate both elevated and decreased hormone levels, including testosterone.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Avoiding\u00a0chronic stressors, getting more\u00a0and\u00a0higher-quality sleep, and lowering abdominal fat percentage through a healthy regimen can help in improving testosterone levels. Additionally, engaging in regular physical activity, including strength training and aerobic exercise, can help support hormone balance, muscle strength, and overall well-being.

In females, estradiol regulates the menstrual cycle, plays a role in fertility and ovulation, and can indicate the presence of PCOS.\u00a0In males, this hormone is important for modulating libido, erectile function, and sperm synthesis.\u00a0Estradiol also operates beyond the reproductive system, including bone health and brain function.\nWhy is estradiol important?\nBecause estrogen is the primary reproductive hormone for females, estradiol (the most potent type of estrogen) is included in\u00a0SiPhox Health\u2018s foundation panel for females. Global Women\u2019s Medicine\u00a0mentions that elevations in estradiol may indicate pregnancy or ovulation, but could also point to underlying conditions such as tumors, PCOS, or liver disease. Decreases in estradiol may indicate menopause, but could also point toward pituitary, adrenal, or ovarian failure.\u00a0Osteoporosis\u00a0(loss of bone mass) occurs frequently with estradiol deficiency, which could be alleviated by hormone replacement therapy.\nSince it is also important for male reproductive health as described above, estradiol is included in the male Hormone+ panel as well.\u00a0According to a\u00a02020 study, men with abnormally high estradiol levels have been associated with erectile dysfunction while abnormally low levels reported low libido and sexual activity. Besides sexual dysfunction,\u00a0abnormally high estradiol levels\u00a0are also linked to loss of muscle mass, fatigue, mood swings,\u00a0abdominal obesity, cardiovascular disease, insulin sensitivity, blood sugar dysregulation, and even enlarged breasts.\nHow can I better understand my estradiol levels?\nEstradiol tests should be taken on\u00a0day 3\u00a0of your menstrual cycle. When interpreting results for estradiol, it is important to consider how dynamic this hormone can be. In menstruating folks, estradiol varies considerably between the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. During perimenopause (the start of menopause), estradiol levels start to decline, and postmenopausal (after menopause) levels remain low with minimal fluctuation. In males, estradiol is low and is relatively static as well.\nThe following graph by\u00a0Straight Healthcare\u00a0shows how variable estradiol can be for menstruating females, along with other hormones that are important for the regulation of\u00a0the menstrual cycle.\n\nTo assist in the interpretation of test results, the\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine\u00a0published reference ranges for estradiol:\nNormally Menstruating Females:\u00a0\n\nFollicular phase: 10 \u2013 180 pg\/mL\nMid-cycle peak: 100 \u2013 300 pg\/mL\nLuteal phase: 40 \u2013 200 pg\/mL\n\nPostmenopausal Females:\n\n&lt; 10 pg\/mL\n\nMales:\n\n\u00a020 \u2013 50 pg\/mL\n\nFor postmenopausal females who are on hormone replacement therapy, an estradiol range between\u00a050-100 pg\/mL can be expected. SiPhox Health results in the 1000s of pg\/mL may be indicative of an underlying issue or may be caused by creams containing bioactive compounds. Some creams contain compounds that mimic naturally produced hormones. Avoid touching bioactive creams with your hands for 48 hours before the test. It is also essential to thoroughly wash your hands with warm water and soap before collection. You should consult your physician if your hormonal result persists on repeat testing.\nHow can I maintain optimal estradiol levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your estradiol levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Consuming foods high in phytoestrogens (fruits, grains, nuts, seeds, soy, veggies) and obtaining sufficient amounts of boron, vitamin B, vitamin D, and vitamin E can help to increase estradiol levels.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Lowering your body fat percentage, managing stress, and abstaining from alcohol can help to lower high estradiol levels.\nSupplementation: If your estradiol levels are low, try taking natural supplements including black cohosh, DHEA, and red clover.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nRead Mount Sinai\u2019s synopsis of their estradiol tests.\nNational Institutes of Health\u00a0\u2013 Estradiol\nStraight Healthcare \u2013 Female Hormone Physiology\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n\n                    \n                                    \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Sign up and get 10% off your first order\n          Sign up to get offers and the latest information on optimizing your health.\n          \n            \n                \n                Sign up\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n          \n                    \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \n                  \n\n\n        \n          \n            Company\n\n                        \n                        SiPhox, Inc.\n111 Terrace Hall Avenue\nBurlington MA 01803 US\nsupport@siphoxhealth.com\n\n                        \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n            Connect with us\n\n                        \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n\n                                    \n            \n                        Disclaimer\n            \n            \n                        \n              \n                The reference ranges and insights presented in the SiPhox Health dashboard are meant to improve readability and provide context, however you should consult with your physician for a more formal interpretation of your results.

Anabolic reactions create or build a product, and one function of testosterone is muscle growth. On the other hand,\u00a0cortisol\u00a0is linked to\u00a0catabolism, which is the breakdown of products. In excess, cortisol may decrease muscle mass.\u00a0As a result, the testosterone:cortisol ratio is generally linked to athletic performance with most athletes seeking\u00a0to increase this ratio to\u00a0enhance tissue repair\u00a0following exercise. Along with\u00a0muscle growth, a high testosterone:cortisol ratio may be linked to\u00a0social aggression\u00a0and\u00a0psychopathy.\nHow can I better understand my testosterone:cortisol ratio?\nWhen interpreting results, it is important to consider the rhythmic fluctuations that both testosterone and cortisol experience throughout the day.\nTestosterone, like many hormones, follows a\u00a0diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning and dipping in the early evening. Peak secretion occurs between 7 and 10 a.m., which is why\u00a0testing testosterone levels in the morning helps to limit variations, particularly in younger men.\n\nCortisol also follows a\u00a0diurnal rhythm that is affected by sleep- naturally rising in the early morning and falling in the evening. It is recommended to test cortisol\u00a0at around\u00a06 \u2013 8 a.m.\n\n\n\u00a0A high testosterone:cortisol ratio is preferred for athletes and may suggest\u00a0well-rested conditions, effective training, or peak performance periods. A low testosterone:cortisol ratio may suggest\u00a0high stress, overtraining, inadequate recovery, or illness. If you are concerned about any of your results, please consult with your physician.\nHow can I maintain an optimal testosterone:cortisol ratio?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your testosterone:cortisol ratio, it is best to focus on improving your testosterone and cortisol levels.

DHEA-S serves as a precursor for testosterone and estrogen, the primary sex hormones for males and females.\nWhy is DHEA-S important?\nDHEA-S levels provide a glimpse into sexual and reproductive health given its connection with testosterone and estrogen. DHEA-S is currently included in the\u00a0SiPhox Health\u00a0male base panel as well as the female Hormone+ panel. It serves as a good\u00a0indicator\u00a0of overall adrenal function and can potentially point toward adrenal tumors or hyperplasia (enlargement).\nHow can I better understand my results?\nGenerally, it is advisable to fall within the higher end of the normal range. To assist in interpreting results,\u00a0Mount\u00a0Sinai\u00a0established normal ranges of DHEA-S broken down by age and sex:\nMale:\n\nAge 18-19: 108-441 ug\/dL\nAge 20-29: 280-640 ug\/dL\nAge 30-39: 120-520\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 40-49: 95-530\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 50-59: 70-310\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 60-69: 42-290\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 69+: 28-175 ug\/dL\n\nFemale:\n\nAge 18-19: 145-395 ug\/dL\nAge 20-29: 65-380 ug\/dL\nAge 30-39: 45-270\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 40-49: 32-240\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 50-59: 26-200\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 60-69: 13-130\u00a0ug\/dL\nAge 69+: 17-90 ug\/dL\n\nAccording to\u00a0MedlinePlus, abnormally high DHEA-S may be caused by adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal tumors, or PCOS in females, while low levels may indicate Addison\u2019s disease or hypopituitarism. It is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned with your results.\nHow can I maintain optimal DHEA-S levels?\nIf you have low DHEA-S, here are some lifestyle modifications you can try:\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0If you want to increase your DHEA-S levels, studies have shown that practicing MSBR (mindfulness-based stress reduction) such as through yoga or meditation may help.

Folic acid is the synthetic form of vitamin B9 that is often used in supplements or fortified foods and is better absorbed than folate.\u00a0Vitamin B9 encompasses both folate and folic acid. Regardless of the form, adequate levels\u00a0are important\u00a0for a multitude of reasons:\u00a0healthy cell growth and function, breaking down\u00a0homocysteine, and critical for fetal development.\nWhy is folate important?\nSiPhox Health\u00a0includes folate in the female Hormone+ panel because of\u00a0its significance\u00a0as a nutrient that\u00a0reduces the risk of birth defects by forming the neural tube. This is particularly useful for individuals who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant and is commonly included in prenatal supplements. Regardless of whether or not you are looking to have children, folate is beneficial for brain function, and low folate has been linked to\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s and depression.\nHow can I better understand my folate levels?\nThe reference range is:\n\n\n2.7 and 17.0 ng\/mL\u00a0\n\n(&gt; 3 ng\/mL is adequate)\n\n\n\nHow can I maintain optimal folate levels?\nThe quantity of folate intake differs for pregnant and non-pregnant\u00a0adult females.

Once\u00a0released into the bloodstream TSH is responsible for stimulating the thyroid gland to produce hormones\u00a0T4\u00a0(thyroxine) and\u00a0T3\u00a0(triiodothyronine).\u00a0T4\u00a0is\u00a0inactive and is thus converted to the active T3 form mainly in the liver, but also in the kidneys, brain, and other organs.\u00a0In a negative feedback mechanism, circulating T3 inhibits both TRH and TSH release.\u00a0A change in\u00a0your TSH level can be an early sign of a thyroid problem.\n\nEndocrineSurgeon.co.uk\nWhy is TSH important?\nTracking your TSH levels allows you to understand the health of your thyroid gland, which is an integral part of your endocrine system. The thyroid gland\u2019s chief\u00a0function\u00a0is to regulate metabolism but also plays an important role in maintaining normal growth and development, body temperature, and energy levels. Because of its significance, TSH is included in\u00a0SiPhox Health\u2018s foundation panel.\nHow can I better understand my TSH levels?\nAccording to\u00a0UCLA Health:\n\nVery low: 0-.5 uIU\/mL\n\nLow: .5-1 uIU\/mL\n\nOptimal: 1-2 uIU\/mL\nHigh: 2-5.0 uIU\/mL\nVery high: &gt;5 uIU\/mL\n\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: .45-5.33 uIU\/mL\nPay attention: &gt;5.33 uIU\/mL\nAlert: &gt;10 uIU\/mL\n\nAlthough for those who are pregnant, have a history of thyroid cancer and\/or pituitary gland disease, or are older, the normal range may be different. If you are concerned with your levels, it is important to consult with your physician.\nHigh TSH may point to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland) whereas low TSH may point to hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland).\u00a0Symptoms of\u00a0hypothyroidism\u00a0include\u00a0lethargy, weight gain, sensitivity to cold, thinning hair, constipation, and other physical and mental issues. Symptoms of\u00a0hyperthyroidism\u00a0on the other hand include weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat, increased hunger, and anxiousness among other issues.\u00a0There are a variety of other conditions that abnormal TSH levels may indicate, including Graves\u2019 disease or Hashimoto\u2019s disease to name a few.\nLike many hormones, TSH follows a\u00a0circadian rhythm\u00a0with maximal concentrations overnight and minimal in the evening. As such, testing TSH in the morning compared to in the afternoon may help detect hypothyroidism in individuals who would otherwise appear normal due to rhythmic fluctuation.\nHow can I maintain optimal TSH levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your TSH levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Avoiding excess iodine intake and following an elimination\/reducing diet can help to lower elevated TSH levels. Adhering to a Mediterranean diet, following a vegetarian diet, and increasing intake of asparagine and serine can aid in increasing TSH levels.\nLifestyle Changes: Quitting smoking, exercising more regularly, and improving sleep quality can help improve elevated TSH levels.\nSupplementation: Various supplements can help improve TSH levels. Co-supplementing with myoinositol and selenium or with zinc, vitamin A, and magnesium can help to lower TSH levels. Ashwagandha root extract can help with this as well.

It is often referred to as \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol because it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your bloodstream, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which can cause atherosclerosis (clogged arteries). HDL-C carries cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it is processed and removed from the body. Having high levels of HDL-C is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, while low levels of HDL-C are associated with an increased risk.\nNote: HDL-C is known as \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol because of its anti-atherogenic effects (which\u00a0prevent plaque from clogging arteries), but high HDL-C can result in negative cardiovascular outcomes, too.\nWhy is HDL-C important?\nHDL-C levels provide another measurement of an individual\u2019s risk of a cardiovascular event. While not as strong an indicator as apolipoprotein B (apoB) or LDL-C, HDL-C provides valuable context to your cardiovascular health. The ratio of triglycerides to HDL-C is one particularly valuable marker with high levels indicating risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. For these reasons, HDL-C is included in SiPhox Health\u2018s foundation panel.\nHow can I better understand my HDL-C levels?\n\nAbnormally low:\u00a0&lt; 23 mg\/dL\n\nMay indicate severe hypertriglyceridemia\n\n\nWorrisome: 23-60 mg\/dL\n\nMay indicate diabetes or coronary heart disease\n\n\nExcellent: 60-92 mg\/dL\n\nProtective against heart disease\n\n\nElevated: 92-100 mg\/dL\n\nAbnormally\u00a0high:\u00a0&gt; 100 mg\/dL\n\n\n\nHigher risk of heart disease\n\n\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: \u2265 80 mg\/dL\nGood: 60-79.99 mg\/dL\nFair: 40-59.9 mg\/dL\nPay attention: &lt;40 mg\/dL\n\nHow can I maintain optimal HDL-C levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your HDL-C levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Sources: Eating more fruits, veggies, omega-3-rich foods (walnuts, wild salmon, chia seeds), and foods high in soluble fiber (whole grains, legumes) can help to improve HDL-C levels. A Mediterranean diet or DASH diet may help as well. Additionally, avoiding animal fats, saturated fats, and salt can help to regulate HDL-C levels.\nLifestyle Changes: Maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in moderate- to high-intensity exercise (aim for 150 minutes of moderate- or 75 minutes of high-intensity per week), and managing your blood sugar and blood pressure can improve HDL-C levels.

It is often referred to as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol because high levels of LDL-C can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in the arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis (the buildup of plaque in the arteries) and increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. LDL-C carries cholesterol from the liver to the cells of the body, but when there is an excess, it can deposit cholesterol in the artery walls, leading to the formation of plaque. Lowering LDL-C levels through lifestyle changes or medication is a key part of managing and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\nNote: While VLDL, IDL, LDL, or Lp(a)\u00a0particles in\u00a0themselves are not \u201cbad\u201d, high levels of these lipoproteins can build up and block arteries (pro-atherogenic). These lipoproteins, however, are healthy in moderation, and very low levels can have negative implications, too.\nWhy is LDL-C important?\nDespite advancements in understanding atherosclerosis risks, LDL-C continues to hold value in\u00a0cardiovascular risk assessment and is included as a biomarker in the SiPhox Health Foundation panel. This persistence is due in part to the extensive body of guidelines and recommendations that still prioritize LDL-C levels. Measuring LDL-P poses challenges due to difficulties in achieving precise measurements. To bridge this gap, SiPhox also includes ApoB in its assessments, offering a broader view of atherogenic particles, encompassing LDL-P.

It is calculated by\u00a0dividing your\u00a0total cholesterol\u00a0level by your\u00a0HDL-C\u00a0level.\nWhy is the total cholesterol:HDL ratio important?\nThe higher the\u00a0TC:HDL\u00a0ratio, the greater the risk of cardiovascular events.\u00a0Total cholesterol\u00a0is calculated by adding\u00a0LDL-C\u00a0(\u201cbad\u201d cholesterol),\u00a0HDL-C\u00a0(\u201cgood\u201d cholesterol), and 20% of\u00a0triglycerides.\u00a0Even if HDL-C is high individually, you could still be at risk for cardiovascular events if LDL-C is even higher. Thus, the ratio can assess your risk much more accurately.\u00a0Recent studies have shown that the\u00a0TC:HDL\u00a0ratio is an important clinical predictor of\u00a0acute myocardial infarction,\u00a0coronary heart disease, and\u00a0cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\u00a0\nHow can I better understand my total cholesterol:HDL ratio?\nTo better interpret your results, here are some values to refer to:\n\n\nHigh risk:\u00a0&gt; 6\n\nModerate risk:\u00a04.5 \u2013 6\n\nLow risk:\u00a0&lt; 4.5\n\nVery good: &lt; 3.5\n\nHow can I maintain an optimal TC:HDL ratio?\nFor more information on how to improve your TC:HDL ratio, please refer to the\u00a0Total Cholesterol\u00a0and\/or\u00a0HDL-C biomarker pages.

After food is consumed, digested fat (fatty acids)\u00a0circulates throughout the body and is taken up by muscle, adipocytes (fat cells), and other energy-demanding tissues. The excess is processed and stored in the liver as triglycerides. When the body needs to rely on its stored energy, such as while fasting, triglycerides are mobilized in a process called lipolysis (fat breakdown). If more triglycerides are stored than are used, this accumulation can be associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes,\u00a0and increased cardiovascular risk. According to\u00a0Cleveland Clinic, 1 in 4 Americans have high triglycerides.\nWhy are triglycerides important?\nAbnormally high triglyceride levels\u00a0increase the risk of atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries), which can lead to\u00a0cardiovascular events\u00a0such as\u00a0carotid artery disease, heart attack, metabolic syndrome, and stroke.\u00a0High triglycerides\u00a0can be linked to underlying causes such as\u00a0diabetes, thyroid disease, and certain medications, to name a few.\u00a0Risk factors\u00a0for high triglycerides include family history, menopause, pregnancy, HIV, metabolic disorders, and being of South Asian ancestry. Because of its significance to our health, triglycerides are included in\u00a0SiPhox Health\u2018s base panel.\nHow can I better understand my triglyceride levels?\nThe\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine\u00a0released reference ranges for fasting triglyceride to assist in interpretation:\n\nLow: 0-100 mg\/dL\n\nOptimal: 70-100 mg\/dL\nNormal: 100-150 mg\/dL\nBorderline High: 150 \u2013 199 mg\/dL\nHigh: 200 \u2013 499 mg\/dL\nVery High: &gt; 500 mg\/dL\n\nWhile an optimal level is considered under 100 mg\/dL, under 50 mg\/dL may indicate\u00a0hypotriglyceridemia. If you are concerned with any of your results, please consult with your physician.\nHow can I maintain optimal triglyceride levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your triglyceride levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Limiting sugar and refined food consumption, eating more fiber, and\u00a0avoiding saturated fats can help in regulating triglyceride levels.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Maintaining a healthy weight,\u00a0exercising regularly, and managing high blood pressure and diabetes can help to reduce triglyceride levels.

ApoA is considered the most informative biomarker for \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol and can be used to determine your risk for cardiovascular disease. ApoA1\u00a0in particular is the most abundant protein associated with HDL-C.\nNote: HDL-C is known as \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol because of its anti-atherogenic effects (prevents plaque from clogging arteries), but high HDL-C can result in negative cardiovascular outcomes as well.\nWhy is ApoA1 important?\nBoth HDL cholesterol and ApoA1 are, in most clinical conditions, anti-atherogenic, so the higher the values, the lower the cardiovascular risk. Your ApoA1 measurement can be an important predictor of cardiovascular health and is thus included in SiPhox Health\u2018s foundation panel.\nHow can I better understand my ApoA1 results?\nMales:\n\n\nNormal: 110-180 mg\/dL\n\nOptimal: &gt;= 115 mg\/dL\n\nAt risk: &lt; 115 mg\/dL\n\nFemales:\n\n\nNormal: 110-205 mg\/dL\n\nOptimal: &gt;=\u00a0125 mg\/dL\n\nAt risk: &lt; 125 mg\/dL\n\nHigh ApoA1 may be caused by genetic disorders, certain medications, or recent weight loss. Low ApoA1 may be caused by diabetes, coronary artery disease, Tangier disease (&lt; 25 mg\/dL), liver disorders, and certain lifestyle choices such as smoking cigarettes. Because ApoA1 levels can be an indicator of many\u00a0deleterious diseases, it is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned with your levels.\u00a0Aim for levels to fall higher\u00a0in the\u00a0normal range.\nHow can I maintain optimal ApoA1 levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your ApoA1 levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Limiting foods with added sugar (sweets, jam, sugar-sweetened beverages) and consuming fermented dairy products (fermented milk, cheese) can help to regulate ApoA1 levels.\nLifestyle Changes: To raise ApoA1 levels, try avoiding smoking and increasing physical activity.

Each particle of VLDL, IDL, LDL, or Lp(a) contains a single molecule of ApoB. Since ApoB measures additional types of \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d rather than just LDL-C, studies\u00a0have shown that ApoB is a better predictor of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction than LDL-C in both men and women, independent of age.\nNote: While VLDL, IDL, LDL, or Lp(a)\u00a0particles in\u00a0themselves are not \u201cbad\u201d, high levels of these lipoproteins can build up and block arteries (pro-atherogenic). These lipoproteins, however, are healthy in moderation, and very low levels can have negative implications as well.\nWhy is ApoB important?\nBecause there is only one ApoB per LDL particle, this measurement gives us the most accurate estimate of the quantity of\u00a0non-HDL cholesterol relative to total cholesterol.\u00a0High\u00a0ApoB\u00a0levels are strongly associated with\u00a0increased risk for\u00a0cardiovascular events and\u00a0shortened lifespan. SiPhox Health includes ApoB in our foundation panel to help monitor and manage ApoB levels.\nHow can I better understand my results?\nTo better interpret your results, here are a few values that can be used to gauge your cardiovascular health. It is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned with any of your results.\n\nLow: &lt; 50 mg\/dL\nOptimal: 50-65 mg\/dL\nNormal: 65-100 mg\/dL\n\nHigh: 100-120 mg\/dL\nHigh risk of vascular disease: &gt; 120\u00a0mg\/dL\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: \u226470 mg\/dL\nGood: 70.1-89.9 mg\/dL\nFair: 90-104.9 mg\/dL\nPay attention: 105-129.9 mg\/dL\nAlert: \u2265130 mg\/dL\n\nHigh ApoB\u00a0results may be indicative of pregnancy, high cholesterol, or kidney issues.\u00a0Low ApoB\u00a0on the other hand may be indicative of sepsis, liver disease, malabsorption, or high estrogen levels.\nHow can I maintain optimal ApoB levels?\nIf your ApoB levels are higher than normal, you can try:\nLifestyle changes: If your ApoB levels are higher than normal, exercising for at least 30 minutes a day and maintaining a healthy weight can help in maintaining healthy ApoB levels. Avoiding tobacco also aids in improving ApoB levels.\nDietary Adjustments: Limiting saturated and trans fat intake can help lower high ApoB levels and increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables. Additionally consuming foods with omega-3s (such as cold-water fish and walnuts), psyllium, and\/or phytosterols (such as nuts and whole grains) can help improve ApoB levels.

It is responsible for stimulating ovulation in females and testosterone production in males. By triggering the release of eggs from the ovaries and promoting the development of the corpus luteum, LH contributes to the menstrual cycle and fertility in women. In men, LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, an essential hormone for male reproductive function.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is LH important?\nLH\u00a0is included in both male and female\u00a0SiPhox Hormone+\u00a0tests because of its importance to\u00a0reproductive health.\u00a0In both males and females, abnormal LH levels may be indicative of pituitary gland disorders. Some symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, weakness, and a decreased appetite.\nFor males, the stimulation of testosterone by LH allows for the production of sperm. Infertility, low libido, and low sperm count are a few reasons for testing LH. High LH levels may be indicative of testicular damage or Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome while low LH could point to pituitary or hypothalamic issues.\nFor females, LH tests are often used to determine the cause of infertility, predict ovulation, and confirm the onset of menopause. LH tests should not, however, be used as a birth control method. High LH may be indicative of PCOS or Turner syndrome.\u00a0Apart from a pituitary gland disorder,\u00a0low LH could point to malnutrition or an eating disorder.\nHow can I better understand my LH levels?\nLH tests should be taken on\u00a0day 3\u00a0of your menstrual cycle. To better interpret your results, the\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine\u00a0has released reference ranges that are included below. For post-menopausal females and males, LH does not typically fluctuate much. However, menstruating females can expect dynamic levels depending on the phase of their cycle.\nMale\n\nNormal: 2\u00a0\u2013 9 mIU\/mL\n\nFemale\n\nFollicular phase of menstrual cycle: 1.68 to 15\u00a0mIU\/mL\n\nMidcycle peak: 21.9 to 56.6\u00a0mIU\/mL\n\nLuteal phase: 0.61 to 16.3\u00a0mIU\/mL\n\nPostmenopausal: 14.2 to 52.3\u00a0mIU\/mL\n\n\nHow can I maintain optimal LH levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your LH levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Following a\u00a0vegetarian diet and increasing fiber intake can help lower LH levels.\nLifestyle Changes: If your LH levels are elevated, try regularly engaging in yoga and quitting cigarette smoking.

It has an important job: carrying and controlling sex hormones in your body, like testosterone and estrogen. When a hormone is bound to SHBG,\u00a0it is\u00a0no longer active as tissues can only use free (not bound) hormones.\nWhy is SHBG important?\nSHBG\u00a0is included in the\u00a0SiPhox Health\u00a0Hormone+ panel for both males and females.\nMales typically take this test to resolve issues related to high SHBG. This is because an excess of SHBG will bind to more testosterone, leaving less free testosterone available for use by the body. On the flip side, females typically take this test when SHBG is low as this results in abnormally high amounts of active, free testosterone.\nWhen total testosterone levels are within the normal reference range, infertility, low libido, and\/or erectile\u00a0dysfunction are a few reasons\u00a0why SHBG levels are tested\u00a0in males. Females often check SHBG levels when experiencing infertility, acne, irregular or lack of menstruation, and\/or excess hair growth.\nHow can I better understand my SHBG levels?\nSHBG\u00a0could be influenced by other underlying conditions. Abnormally high levels of SHBG may be indicative of pregnancy, weight loss, hepatitis B or C, hemochromatosis, hyperthyroidism, and a few other conditions. Abnormally low levels could be caused by obesity, insulin resistance (possibly related to metabolic disease or diabetes), PCOS, fatty liver disease,\u00a0or\u00a0other factors.\nAccording to\u00a0Mayo Clinic Laboratories, normal reference ranges for adults are:\n\nMales: 13.3-89.5 nmol\/L\nFemales (nonpregnant, menstruating): 18.2-135.5 nmol\/L\nFemales (nonpregnant, menopausal): 16.8-125.2 nmol\/L\n\nFor a male age breakdown,\u00a0Exeter Clinical Laboratory\u00a0includes reference ranges:\n\n&lt; 50 years old: 18.3 \u2013 54.8 nmol\/L\n&gt; 50 years old: 20.6 \u2013 76.7 nmol\/L\n\nSHBG is expected to\u00a0increase in males and\u00a0decrease in females with age, but other factors including obesity and underlying conditions may vary the normal range. For this reason, please consult with your physician if you are concerned about any of your biomarker values.\nHow can I maintain optimal SHBG levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your SHBG levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Increasing\u00a0protein intake can help to lower SHBG levels. On the other hand, limiting saturated fat intake, increasing\u00a0fiber intake, and consuming more olive oil (and other sources of monounsaturated fatty acids) can help to increase SHBG levels.\nLifestyle Changes: Quitting\u00a0cigarette smoking and abstaining from alcohol can help to lower elevated SHBG levels.

In women, it is primarily known for regulating milk production after childbirth (lactation) and playing a role in the menstrual cycle. It also affects male reproductive health by regulating testosterone production, impacting libido, erectile function, and fertility. In both men and women, prolactin is released in response to stress, sleep, and other factors, and can have interactions with cortisol and thyroid hormones. [1]\nWhy is prolactin important?\nPRL is critical for the analysis of a variety of issues, and abnormal levels may indicate pituitary gland irregularities, including tumors. SiPhox Health includes PRL in our Hormone+ Panel to help monitor and manage PRL levels.\nIn men, low PRL is correlated with negative metabolic, psychological, and sexual characteristics. On the other hand, high PRL can inhibit testosterone production, causing decreased energy, muscle mass, and blood count (anemia). High PRL can also lead to erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and low sperm production\nIn women, low PRL can impede sufficient breast milk production. While high PRL can cause menstrual cycle and ovulation irregularities. High PRL levels can cause vaginal dryness and a milky discharge from the nipples when not pregnant (galactorrhea). Additionally, females of reproductive age with either abnormally low and abnormally high PRL may be more prone to cardiovascular and metabolic complications.\nHow can I better understand my Prolactin levels?\nAccording to Mount Sinai, normal PRL values are:\n\n\nMen: &lt;20 ng\/mL\n\nNonpregnant women: &lt;25 ng\/mL\n\nPregnant women: 80-400 ng\/mL\n\nIn\u00a0both men and women, certain medications (antipsychotic, cardiovascular, opiates, etc.), health conditions (infections, autoimmune disease, Sheehan syndrome, etc.), and pituitary gland disorders (prolactinomas or pituitary gland tumors) can all cause abnormally high or low levels of prolactin, which is why it is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned about any of your results. It is important to remember that prolactin levels follow a circadian rhythm associated with the onset of sleep and can appear higher or lower depending on a multitude of factors, with the\u00a0optimal timing for\u00a0blood\u00a0tests being 2-3 hours after waking and while fasting. [2]\nHow can I maintain optimal Prolactin levels?\nIf your PRL levels are abnormal, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Consuming a diet rich in tyrosine (dopamine precursor) and vitamin C (dopamine inhibitor) can help to lower prolactin levels since dopamine suppresses prolactin. Limiting gluten consumption can also help to decrease prolactin production since gluten stimulates prolactin release.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Limiting alcohol consumption can help to decrease prolactin levels and increase testosterone levels. Reducing stressors can also aid in mitigating higher prolactin levels.\nSupplementation: Consuming vitamin B6, vitamin E, zinc, or ashwagandha supplements could aid in lowering elevated prolactin levels. Including these nutrients in your diet can also help to decrease prolactin levels. If your PRL levels are slightly low, many women try\u00a0pharmacologic or natural galactagogues\u00a0(milk boosters) such as\u00a0fenugreek to raise PRL levels and promote lactation.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nLongdom \u2013 The Role of Prolactin in Men\nNIH \u2013 Hyperprolactinemia\nWolters Kluwer \u2013 Patient education: High prolactin levels and prolactinomas\nSynlab \u2013 Drugs Causing Hyperprolactinaemia\nScience Direct \u2013 Low prolactin is associated with sexual dysfunction and psychological or metabolic disturbances in middle-aged and elderly men\nSpringer Link \u2013 Cardiometabolic profile of young women with\u00a0hypoprolactinemia\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n References[+] \n\nReferences  &#13;\n&#13;\n 1 \nAl-Chalabi M, Bass AN, Alsalman I.

It is involved in sexual development and reproduction for both males and females. In females, FSH stimulates the production of\u00a0estradiol\u00a0and regulates the menstrual cycle, peaking just before ovulation. In males, FSH works with\u00a0testosterone\u00a0to maintain normal sperm count and function.\nWhy is FSH important?\nGiven its\u00a0significance in regulating the menstrual cycle, FSH is included in\u00a0SiPhox Health\u2018s base panel for females but is also included in the male Hormone+ panel due to its importance to reproductive health.\u00a0Measuring FSH\u00a0is helpful to both males and females who are interested in their fertility status and are looking to become pregnant.\nFor females, high FSH may indicate primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), perimenopause, ovarian tumor, or Turner syndrome. Low FSH may indicate pituitary gland disorder, hypothalamus disorder, insufficient egg production, or that you are very underweight. For males, high FSH may indicate testicular damage or\u00a0Klinefelter syndrome, while low FSH may indicate pituitary gland or hypothalamus disorders. For these reasons, if you are concerned with your results, it is important to consult with your physician.\nHow can I better understand my FSH levels?\nFSH tests should be taken\u00a0on\u00a0day 3\u00a0of your menstrual cycle. When interpreting results for FSH, it is important to consider how dynamic this hormone can be. In menstruating folks,\u00a0FSH varies considerably between the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Levels increase with age, but a surge occurs during perimenopause (the start of menopause)\u00a0and\u00a0remains high post-menopause. In males,\u00a0FSH is low and is relatively static in comparison.\nThe following graph by\u00a0Straight Healthcare\u00a0shows how variable\u00a0FSH can be for menstruating females, along with other hormones that are important for the regulation of\u00a0the menstrual cycle.\n\nTo assist in the interpretation of test results, the\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine\u00a0published reference ranges for FSH:\nNormally Menstruating Females:\u00a0\n\nFollicular phase:\u00a02 \u2013 9\u00a0mIU\/mL\nMid-cycle peak:\u00a04 \u2013 22\u00a0mIU\/mL\n\nLuteal phase:\u00a02\u00a0\u2013\u00a09\u00a0mIU\/mL\n\n\nPostmenopausal Females:\n\n&gt; 30 mIU\/mL\n\nMales:\n\n1 \u2013 7\u00a0mIU\/mL\n\nAbnormally high or low levels of FSH\u00a0could\u00a0be indicative of a more serious issue, so please consult with your physician if you are concerned with any of your results.\nHow can I maintain optimal FSH levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your FSH levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Taking\u00a0probiotics can help to increase FSH levels.\nLifestyle Changes: Weight loss can help to lower FSH levels, and exercising\u00a0(especially\u00a0HIIT) can help raise FSH levels.\nSupplementation:\u00a0If you want to lower FSH levels, supplement\u00a0with royal jelly,\u00a0omega-3 fatty acid,\u00a0vitamin D, or\u00a0zinc.

PSA helps keep the semen in a liquid state, which helps sperm move.\n\nWhy is PSA important?\nSiPhox Health\u00a0includes PSA in the male Hormone+ panel because of\u00a0its significance as a marker for prostate health.\nAccording to the\u00a0American Cancer Society,\u00a0prostate cancer will occur in 1 in 8 men during their lifetime and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men after lung cancer in the U.S. Because PSA is secreted by the prostate, elevated PSA levels may be indicative of an enlarged prostate gland\u00a0caused by cancer.\nMeasuring and analyzing PSA levels can lead to a variety of helpful checks, such as:\n\nProstate Health\n\nA PSA test is often used to check for problems with the prostate. Measuring PSA levels is critical to understanding inflammation and other diseases in the prostate, including cancer.\n\n\nChecking Cancer Treatment\n\nIf you\u2019ve been treated for prostate cancer, your doctor might use the PSA test to see if the treatment is working or if the cancer has come back.\n\n\n\nHow can I better understand my PSA levels?\nPSA levels vary by age, and the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic\u00a0has released reference ranges accordingly:\n\n\n\nAge\nNormal level (ng\/mL)\nAbnormal level (ng\/mL)\n\n\n40 \u2013 50\n0 \u2013 2.5\n&gt; 2.5\n\n\n50 \u2013 60\n2.5 \u2013 3.5\n&gt; 3.5\n\n\n60 \u2013 70\n3.5 \u2013 4.5\n&gt; 4.5\n\n\n70 \u2013 80\n4.5 \u2013 5.5\n&gt; 5.5\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nAccording to the\u00a0American Cancer Society, a PSA between 4 and 10 ng\/mL is equivalent to a 25% chance of having prostate cancer, while a PSA over 10 ng\/mL increases the likelihood to over 50%.\u00a0Some factors, such as certain medications and even obesity, may lower PSA and make this test a misleading representation of your actual cancer risk. If you are concerned with your results, please consult with your physician to seek treatment.\nIt is important to note that not everyone with a high PSA has prostate cancer, and even people with low PSA\u00a0can have prostate cancer.

It\u2019s one of the most common proteins in your blood and\u00a0serves various critical bodily functions. One important role it plays is to carry hormones (testosterone, for example), vitamins, and enzymes throughout the body, but albumin levels can also indicate liver and kidney health.\nWhy is albumin important?\nSiPhox Health\u00a0includes albumin in the male Hormone+ panel because of its significance to testosterone transport.\u00a0Albumin-bound testosterone\u00a0accounts for the majority (50 \u2013 68%) of the total testosterone in males. The quantity of albumin in the bloodstream is important because free testosterone (not bound) is biologically active. If albumin concentrations are high, there is less free testosterone, and thus less biologically active testosterone available.\nAlbumin testing can provide the following information:\n\nNutritional Analysis:\u00a0If your albumin levels are low, it could mean that you\u2019re not getting enough protein in your diet, or your body is not absorbing food properly.\nLiver Health: Because albumin is primarily made in the liver, if levels are low, it could mean your liver isn\u2019t working well. Low albumin levels can be a marker of liver dysfunction, as conditions like cirrhosis or acute liver failure can significantly impair the liver\u2019s ability to produce albumin. Chronic liver diseases affect albumin levels due to either decreased production by damaged liver cells or increased loss through the kidneys when liver disease leads to kidney dysfunction. Check with your provider regarding further information.\nKidney\u00a0Health:\u00a0The kidneys filter blood, removing waste products while retaining essential proteins like albumin. Healthy kidneys typically prevent large molecules like albumin from being filtered out of the blood and excreted in the urine.\u00a0Elevated levels of albumin in the urine, a condition known as albuminuria or microalbuminuria (when the levels are lower but still above normal), can be an early sign of kidney disease. Monitoring albumin levels in the urine helps in the early detection and management of kidney disease.\u00a0Ask your provider for more information.\nHormonal Balance: One of the most important functions of albumin is to carry hormones such as testosterone around the body. If your doctor wants to run tests on your free\/bioavailable testosterone levels, they will typically analyze your albumin count.\n\nHow can I better understand my albumin results?\nHere is the general range for interpreting albumin results:\n\n\nNormal range: 3.5 \u2013 5.5 g\/dL\n\n\nUNC Kidney Center defines 4 g\/dL as the optimal concentration of albumin\n\n\n\n\nLow levels can be a sign of malnutrition, due to a lack of protein and calories. Lack of albumin may also be caused by burns or infections. In some cases, it is the cause of pre-existing health conditions, but it could also be a sign of a more serious health issue. For information about these, talk to your doctor about your albumin levels.\u00a0\nHigh levels\u00a0are fairly uncommon and may mean that your body is dehydrated. Just as low levels could be a sign of little protein, high levels might indicate an abundance of it.

You can obtain B12 by consuming animal products, nutritional yeast,\u00a0or fortified foods. B12 helps your body make red blood cells, helps with DNA production, and is required for the development and function of the brain and spinal cord.\nWhy is vitamin B12 important?\nSiPhox Health\u00a0includes B12 in the female Hormone+ panel because of its significance to reproductive health and pregnancy.\nB12 is critical for the analysis of a variety of issues:\n\nAnemia Check\n\nLow B12 levels may cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. This is when your body can\u2019t make enough healthy red blood cells, which can leave you feeling weak and tired.\n\n\nNerve Function\n\nLong-term B12 deficiency may lead to nerve damage, which can cause tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, balance problems, and memory difficulties (dementia).\n\n\nHealth in Older Adults\n\nSometimes, older people have trouble absorbing B12, which can lead to a deficiency.

It is produced by the testes in males and the ovaries in females. In males, it is responsible for sperm and hormonal production, while in females it creates eggs and female hormones. AMH is the most accurate predictor of ovarian reserve (a woman\u2019s egg supply). A higher AMH indicates a greater egg supply.\nWhy is AMH important?\nSiPhox Health\u00a0includes AMH in the female Hormone+ panel because of\u00a0its significance as a marker for reproductive function. This is particularly useful for individuals who are trying to get pregnant.\nAMH is critical for the analysis of a variety of issues:\n\nChecking Egg Supply\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman trying to get pregnant, knowing your AMH levels can give you an idea of your egg supply, or \u201covarian reserve.\u201d A higher level usually means you have more eggs, while a lower level might mean fewer eggs.\n\n\nFertility Treatments\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble getting pregnant and are considering fertility treatments like IVF (in-vitro fertilization), doctors use AMH levels to help decide on the best approach.\n\n\nUnderstanding Irregular Periods\n\nSometimes, if a woman has frequently irregular periods, a doctor might check AMH levels along with other hormones to see if a more serious condition is the cause.\n\n\n\nAMH testing\u00a0can also be used to monitor the onset of menopause and help diagnose ovarian problems such as PCOS or ovarian cancer.\nHow can I better understand my AMH levels?\nSince AMH varies with age,\u00a0Cleveland Clinic\u00a0has released estimates of \u201cgood\u201d AMH levels:\n\n\n\nAge\n\u201cGood\u201d AMH level (ng\/mL)\n\n\n25\n&gt; 3.0\n\n\n30\n&gt; 2.5\n\n\n35\n&gt; 1.5\n\n\n40\n&gt; 1.0\n\n\n45\n&gt; 0.5\n\n\n\n\nAverage: 1 \u2013 3 ng\/mL\nLow: &lt; 1 ng\/mL\nSeverely low: &lt; 0.5 ng\/mL\n\nUnlike\u00a0FSH,\u00a0LH, and\u00a0estradiol\u00a0which\u00a0should be tested on the third day of your menstrual cycle, AMH can be tested at any time.\u00a0AMH levels can be expected to peak in females at around 25 years old, followed by a natural decline. While high AMH is generally considered to be good for those who are looking to get pregnant as it is indicative of greater ovarian reserve and fertility, individuals with PCOS may also experience high AMH levels which\u00a0can\u00a0make conceiving difficult\u00a0(learn more\u00a0here).\nLower levels of AMH can indicate a shortage of eggs in the ovaries. This could increase the difficulty of pregnancy. Higher levels of AMH can indicate an abundance of eggs in the ovaries. In some cases, it could be a symptom of a more serious condition.\nDiminished ovarian reserve\u00a0usually occurs around menopause, and the average age of menopause is in the early 50s. At this time, low AMH is normal. It is important to understand that while AMH is an indicator of ovarian reserve, it does not provide information on egg quality or health, and does not necessarily correlate with fertility. Females with low AMH may be able to conceive naturally as many factors influence fertility. If you are concerned with your results, please consult with your physician to seek treatment.\nHow can I maintain optimal AMH levels?\nDietary Changes: Consuming dairy products may decrease the rate of AMH decline and decreasing dietary fat intake may help to increase AMH levels.

While bound T3 (attached to proteins) is unable to enter and act on the body\u2019s tissues, free T3 is able to enter tissues and act more readily.\nWhy is free T3 important?\nTracking your free T3 levels allows you to understand the health of your thyroid gland, which is an integral part of your endocrine system.\u00a0Thyroid hormones\u00a0are vital to metabolism, heart and digestive functions, muscle control, brain development, and bone maintenance, among other roles. Because of its significance, free T3 is included in\u00a0SiPhox Health\u2018s Thyroid+ panel.\nHigh free T3 may point to hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland), which can be caused by autoimmune diseases or thyroid gland inflammation (thyroiditis). Low\u00a0free T3 may point to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland).\u00a0Symptoms of\u00a0hyperthyroidism may\u00a0include weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat, increased hunger, and anxiousness among other issues.\u00a0Symptoms of\u00a0hypothyroidism\u00a0on the other hand may\u00a0include\u00a0lethargy, weight gain, sensitivity to cold, thinning hair, constipation, and other physical and mental issues. If you are concerned with your levels, it is important to consult with your physician.\nHow can I better understand my free T3 levels?\nAccording to the\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine:\n\nLow: &lt;1.9 pg\/mL\nOptimal: 3.2-3.9 pg\/mL\nNormal: 1.9 \u2013 4.4 pg\/mL\nHigh: &gt;4.4 pg\/mL\n\nFree T3 test results are analyzed in conjunction with other thyroid tests to determine whether the thyroid gland is functioning properly.\nLike many hormones, T3 follows a\u00a0circadian rhythm\u00a0related to the cycles of TSH and T4. Free T3\u00a0is generally at its highest concentration at around 4am and at its lowest concentration at around 4pm. As such, testing in the morning compared to in the afternoon may help detect hypothyroidism in individuals who would otherwise appear normal due to rhythmic fluctuation.\nHow can I maintain optimal free T3 levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your free T3 levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Consuming less\u00a0iodine and eating more\u00a0cruciferous veggies can help in reducing elevated free T3 levels. If your free T3 levels are low, ensure adequate calorie and carb intake.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0If your T3 levels are low, try managing your inflammation, reducing stress, and improving sleep quality and duration.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nMedlinePlus \u2013 T3 test\nLevel Up RN (video) \u2013\u00a0TSH and T3\/T4 \u2013 What\u2019s the difference?\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n\n                    \n                                    \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Sign up and get 10% off your first order\n          Sign up to get offers and the latest information on optimizing your health.\n          \n            \n                \n                Sign up\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n          \n                    \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \n                  \n\n\n        \n          \n            Company\n\n                        \n                        SiPhox, Inc.\n111 Terrace Hall Avenue\nBurlington MA 01803 US\nsupport@siphoxhealth.com\n\n                        \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n            Connect with us\n\n                        \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n\n                                    \n            \n                        Disclaimer\n            \n            \n                        \n              \n                The reference ranges and insights presented in the SiPhox Health dashboard are meant to improve readability and provide context, however you should consult with your physician for a more formal interpretation of your results.

Low\u00a0free T4 may point to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland) which can be caused by autoimmune diseases, inadequate iodine intake, or certain medications.\u00a0Symptoms of\u00a0hyperthyroidism\u00a0may\u00a0include weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat, and increased bowel movements\u00a0among other issues.\u00a0Symptoms of\u00a0hypothyroidism\u00a0on the other hand may\u00a0include fatigue, weight gain, sensitivity to cold,\u00a0low heart rate, and other physical and mental issues. If you are concerned with your levels, it is important to consult with your physician.\nHow can I better understand my free T4 levels?\nAccording to the\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine:\n\nLow: &lt;.59 ng\/dL\n\nOptimal: 1.1- 1.22 ng\/dL\n\nNormal: 0.59 \u2013 1.22 ng\/dL\nHigh: &gt;1.22 ng\/dL\n\n\nFree T4 test results are analyzed in conjunction with other thyroid tests to determine whether the thyroid gland is functioning properly.\nWhile other thyroid hormones like T3 and TSH can fluctuate throughout the day,\u00a0T4 remains relatively stable for each person.\nHow can I maintain optimal free T4 levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your free T4 levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Consuming less\u00a0iodine and eating more\u00a0cruciferous veggies can help to lower high free T4 levels.

TPO Antibodies (TPOAb), also known as antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, are found in some individuals whose immune systems mistakenly target the thyroid gland and produce antibodies against TPO. The presence of these antibodies is indicative of potential dysfunction of the thyroid gland.\nWhy is the thyroid peroxidase antibody important?\nTracking your\u00a0TPOAb level allows you to understand the health of your thyroid gland, which is an integral part of your endocrine system.\u00a0Thyroid hormones\u00a0are vital to metabolism, heart and digestive functions, muscle control, brain development, and bone maintenance, among other roles, so abnormal TPOAb could affect your overall health and wellness.\u00a0Because of its significance as an indicator of chronic disease and cancer,\u00a0TPOAb is included in\u00a0SiPhox Health\u2018s Thyroid+ panel.\nThe TPOAb test is usually suggested for people who are experiencing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism to determine whether an autoimmune disease is an underlying cause. One common autoimmune disease, Hashimoto\u2019s,\u00a0is typically accompanied by weight gain, fatigue, hair loss, low tolerance for cold temperatures, irregular periods, constipation, depression, and joint pain.\u00a0Graves\u2019 disease, on the other hand, has symptoms including weight loss, bulging eyes, hand tremors, low heat tolerance, trouble sleeping, anxiety, increased heart rate, and an enlarged thyroid gland.\nHow can I better understand my TPOAb levels?\nAccording to\u00a0Mayo Clinic Laboratories:\n\nNormal: &lt; 9.0 IU\/mL\nOptimal: &lt;4 IU\/mL\n\nHigh: &gt;9 IU\/mL\n\n\nIf your TPOAb results are raised, please consult with your physician as this may be indicative of an autoimmune disease such as Hashimoto\u2019s disease or Graves\u2019 disease, and although less common, could be a marker for cancer. According to British Thyroid Foundation, while ~90% of people with elevated TPOAb have an autoimmune disease, ~10% do not have thyroid disease at all.

ALT is an enzyme found primarily in the liver. Although ALT is also present in smaller amounts in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas, its concentration in the liver and its release into the bloodstream in response to liver cell damage makes it a significant marker for liver health.\nWhy is ALT important?\nThe importance of ALT lies in its role as an indicator of liver health. When liver cells are damaged due to causes such as viral infections (like hepatitis), excessive alcohol consumption, or drug toxicity, ALT is released into the bloodstream. Therefore, an elevated ALT level often suggests liver inflammation or damage. But what\u2019s the difference between the two liver enzymes ALT and\u00a0AST\u00a0(aspartate aminotransferase)? \u201cBoth aminotransferases are highly concentrated in the liver. AST is also diffusely represented in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain and red blood cells, and ALT has low concentrations in skeletal muscle and kidney;\u00a0an increase in ALT serum levels is, therefore, more specific for liver damage.\u201d\u00a0(Giannini, 2005)\nFrequently checking ALT levels can help diagnose liver diseases early and monitor the progression of a liver condition or the effectiveness of a certain treatment regimen. If ALT is chronically elevated, it is important to try and understand the potential causes.\u00a0While ALT is more specific\u00a0to the liver than AST, your muscles, kidneys and other organs can also make ALT. So to better understand what an abnormal ALT means, it\u2019s best to consult with your physician if you are concerned about your liver enzyme results.\nHow can I better understand my ALT levels?\nALT typically be presented in units per liter (U\/L). The \u201cnormal reference\u201d ranges can vary slightly between laboratories but generally fall within the range of:\n\nAdults: ~11 to ~52 units per liter (U\/L)\n\nThe \u201cnormal\u201d reference range for women is often lower than for men.\n\n\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: \u2264 25 U\/L\nGood: 25.1-34.9 U\/L\nFair: 35-44.9 U\/L\nPay attention: \u2265 45 U\/L\nAlert: &gt;80 U\/L\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that these \u201cnormal\u201d ranges are based on average values from a specific population, and it is hard to know the general health of this population that was used to come up with the \u201cnormal\u201d range. Factors such as age, gender, race, and even muscle mass can influence ALT levels. Therefore, the population used to develop these ranges might not align with your specific health profile or goals. In general, lower is typically better.\nFor instance, slightly elevated ALT levels could be considered normal for some individuals, depending on various health and lifestyle factors. Conversely, a result within the \u201cnormal\u201d range doesn\u2019t always guarantee a perfectly healthy liver. It\u2019s also important to consider other liver enzyme tests, like AST, and the overall clinical context.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nCleveland Clinic: Alanine Transaminase (ALT)\nMedscape: Alanine Aminotransferase\nKalas, MA, et al. 2021.

It\u2019s found in various tissues throughout the body. The widespread presence of AST, especially in vital organs like the liver and heart, underlines its importance in routine health assessments.\nWhile both AST and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) are enzymes related to liver function, AST\u2019s presence in the heart, kidneys, brain, and muscles sets it apart. This broader distribution means that elevated AST levels can indicate issues beyond liver damage, including heart conditions or muscle damage. Therefore, AST levels are often evaluated alongside ALT levels to get a more comprehensive view of liver health and to help pinpoint the source of tissue damage.\nWhy is AST important?\nAST\u2019s significance lies in its ability to signal tissue damage. Elevated levels of AST in the blood can indicate liver damage, as with ALT, but can also suggest problems in other organs, particularly the heart. This makes AST a versatile marker for assessing overall health and diagnosing specific conditions.\nMonitoring AST levels can aid in diagnosing conditions such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and heart diseases. It also plays a crucial role in evaluating the severity of diseases and the effectiveness of treatments, offering a broader perspective on one\u2019s health status.\nHow can I better understand my AST results?\nAST test results are typically expressed in units per liter (U\/L), similar to ALT. The \u201cnormal reference\u201d ranges can vary by laboratory but are generally in the range of:\n\nAdults: ~13 to ~39 units per liter (U\/L). The\n\n\u201cnormal\u201d reference range for women is often lower than for men.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that these \u201cnormal\u201d ranges are based on average values from a specific population, and it is hard to know the general health of this population that was used to come up with the \u201cnormal\u201d range. Factors such as age, gender, race, and even muscle mass can influence AST levels. Therefore, the population used to develop these ranges might not align with your specific health profile or goals. In general, lower is typically better.\nFor instance, slightly elevated AST levels could be considered normal for some individuals, depending on various health and lifestyle factors. Conversely, a result within the \u201cnormal\u201d range doesn\u2019t always guarantee a perfectly healthy liver. It\u2019s also important to consider other liver enzyme tests, like ALT (Aspartate Aminotransferase), and the overall clinical context.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nCleveland Clinic: AST\nMedscape: AST\nKalas, MA, et al. 2021.

It\u2019s produced from creatine, a molecule of major importance for energy production in muscles. Once created, creatinine is transported through the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is filtered out of the blood and excreted in urine.\nThe measurement of creatinine levels in the blood offers vital insights into kidney function. This is because the kidneys are responsible for filtering creatinine out of the blood. If the kidneys are damaged or not functioning properly, blood creatinine levels can rise due to decreased filtration. Therefore, creatinine tests are crucial in assessing renal function and detecting kidney disease.\nWhy is creatinine important?\nCreatinine levels are a reliable indicator of kidney health for several reasons:\n\n\nKidney Function Assessment: High levels of creatinine in the blood often suggest impaired kidney function or kidney disease. Since the kidneys filter and remove creatinine from the bloodstream, elevated levels can indicate that the kidneys are not working effectively.\n\nDisease Progression and Monitoring: For individuals diagnosed with kidney disease, monitoring changes in blood creatinine levels can help assess the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment strategies.\n\nGuiding Treatment: In certain medical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), accurate measurement of creatinine levels is essential for making informed decisions about treatment and management, including the need for dialysis.\n\nHow can I better understand my creatinine levels?\nCreatinine is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL) in blood and milligrams per 24 hours (mg\/24 h) in urine. The normal range for blood creatinine levels varies depending on age, gender, and muscle mass, and different labs have different reference ranges. According to the\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine, serum creatinine levels are:\n\n\nAdult males: Approximately 0.70 to 1.30 mg\/dL\n\nAdult females: Approximately 0.50 to 1.10 mg\/dL\n\nHigher muscle mass might result in higher creatinine levels; thus, levels can vary widely among individuals. It\u2019s crucial to interpret these levels within the context of\u00a0eGFR\u00a0(estimated glomerular filtration rate) and other kidney function tests for a comprehensive assessment of renal health.\nHow can I maintain optimal creatinine levels?\nIf you have kidney damage, aiming for lower creatinine levels is recommended. The following tips from\u00a0UCLA Health\u00a0are easy lifestyle modifications that may help with lowering creatinine levels and avoiding further kidney damage:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Limiting meat intake can help lower creatinine because the most potent source of its precursor, creatine, is meat. Incorporating more high-fiber foods into your diet has been shown in several studies to lower serum creatinine levels.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Staying hydrated is important as dehydration can raise creatinine levels. To maintain kidney health, quitting tobacco, limiting sodium intake, and avoiding NSAIDs can minimize renal strain.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nAmerican Kidney Fund \u2013 Avoid the superfood trap: Tips to improve your creatinine and eGFR\nUCLA Health \u2013 High creatinine levels can indicate chronic kidney disease\nScientific Literature:\n\nAbcar AC, Chan L, Yeoh H.

It estimates the amount of blood that gets filtered by the glomeruli (tiny filters in the kidneys) each minute. The following image depicts the complexity of the kidney, starting with the nephron.\n\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases \u2013 Glomerular Disease\nThe nephron is the basic\u00a0structural and functional unit of the kidney, responsible for the vital process of filtering blood, removing waste products, and regulating water and solute balance in the body. Each human kidney contains approximately one million nephrons, which work collectively to perform the kidney\u2019s complex functions. The structure of a nephron is specially designed to efficiently filter blood, reabsorb necessary nutrients and water, and excrete waste products in the form of urine.\nThe glomerulus plays a crucial role within the kidney as a component of the nephron. The glomerulus is a network of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) located at the beginning of the nephron. Its roles include:\n\n\nBlood Filtration: The glomerulus is where the filtration of blood begins. Blood pressure forces water, salt, glucose, amino acids, and waste products (like urea and\u00a0creatinine) from the blood through the capillary walls and into the Bowman\u2019s capsule, another part of the nephron that collects the filtrate. The filtrate then travels through the rest of the nephron, where further processing occurs.\n\nPrevention of Protein Loss: The structure of the glomerulus prevents large molecules, such as proteins and blood cells, from being filtered into the urine, retaining them within the bloodstream.\n\nThe eGFR is calculated based on your blood\u00a0creatinine\u00a0level, age, body size, and gender. This calculation provides a critical insight into the kidney\u2019s health, indicating how efficiently they\u2019re filtering waste from your blood.\nUnlike direct measurements of kidney function, which can be invasive and complex, eGFR offers a simple and non-invasive way to monitor kidney health. It\u2019s a crucial part of any comprehensive health assessment, particularly for those with risk factors for kidney disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, or a family history of kidney failure.\nWhy is eGFR Important?\nThe primary importance of eGFR lies in its role in detecting and monitoring kidney disease. According to the\u00a0National Kidney Foundation, 33% (1 in 3 people) of American adults are at risk for kidney disease. Healthy kidneys ensure the removal of toxins and waste materials from the blood, maintaining a delicate balance of body fluids and electrolytes. A decline in eGFR can indicate a reduction in kidney function, signaling acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to CKD, impaired kidneys can cause heart disease, heart attack and stroke, high blood pressure, weak bones, nerve damage, and low red blood cell count.\nMonitoring eGFR levels is essential for diagnosing conditions that affect kidney function, assessing the severity of kidney damage, and guiding the management and treatment of kidney-related disorders. It\u2019s particularly important for individuals with conditions that can impair kidney function, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\nHow can I better understand my eGFR results?\neGFR results are typically reported in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m\u00b2 (mL\/min\/1.73 m\u00b2). When interpreting eGFR results, this table from the\u00a0National Kidney Foundation\u00a0illustrates how even normal kidney function could accompany kidney damage:\n\nNational Kidney Foundation \u2013 eGFR: A key to understanding how well your kidneys are working\nAccording to the UK Kidney Association:\n\nHealthy: ~60-120 mL\/min\/1.73 m\u00b2\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: \u2265100 mL\/min\/1.73 m\u00b2\nGood: 90-99.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m\u00b2\nFair: 80.1-89.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m\u00b2\nPay attention: \u2264 80 mL\/min\/1.73 m\u00b2\nAlert: &lt;60 mL\/min\/1.73 m\u00b2\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that eGFR is an estimate of kidney function and must be interpreted within the context of other clinical findings and patient factors. For example, a mildly decreased eGFR in an elderly individual without any other signs of kidney disease may be considered normal aging. Conversely, even a slight decrease in eGFR in a young adult may warrant further investigation. American Kidney Fund\u00a0recommends discussing your eGFR results with your doctor, and doing so immediately if your levels are 60 or less is very important.\nHow can I maintain optimal eGFR levels?\nWhile improving renal function is not easy, it is possible. A\u00a0study from 2013\u00a0found that it is possible to improve renal function at any stage of CKD!\nIn addition to staying healthy and reducing blood pressure and blood sugar through weight management, regular exercise, following a balanced diet, and practicing healthy habits (quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake), the National Kidney Foundation\u00a0also recommends that people with kidney disease should:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Reducing salt intake can help improve kidney function. Action on Salt states that a high salt diet can disrupt the balance of sodium and limit kidney function, promoting high blood pressure and straining the kidneys. Moderate protein consumption, according to this study from 2018, can reduce potential glomeruli damage caused by high protein intake. A low-protein diet can preserve renal function in those who have CKD.\nLifestyle Changes: According to the\u00a0American Journal of Kidney Diseases, NSAIDs can harm kidney function by reducing blood flow and prostaglandin (maintains GFR and renal blood flow) production, impairing sodium and water excretion, leading to acute kidney injury. So refrain from using NSAIDs. Additionally, getting an annual flu shot can help since the CDC emphasizes the importance of the flu vaccine for people with CKD who are \u201cat high risk of developing serious flu complications\u201d. Additionally,\u00a0exercise therapy\u00a0and certain\u00a0dietary patterns\u00a0may be associated with a lower rate of eGFR decline.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nAmerican Kidney Fund \u2013 Blood Test: eGFR\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases \u2013 Your Kidneys &amp; How They Work\nUK Kidney Association \u2013 About eGFR\nNational Kidney Foundation \u2013 eGFR: A key to understanding how well your kidneys are working\nScientific Literature\n\nCai Q, Dekker LH, Bakker SJL, de Borst MH, Navis GJ.

It provides insight into the body\u2019s ability to maintain and regulate blood sugar levels within a narrow range, even in the absence of food intake.\nWhy is fasting glucose important?\nSiPhox Health includes fasting glucose in our Metabolic+ Upgrade to help monitor and manage fasting glucose levels. According to the CDC, approximately 38.4 million Americans have diabetes, and around 8.7 million may be undiagnosed. Fasting glucose levels are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring various metabolic disorders, including prediabetes, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. Elevated fasting glucose levels indicate impaired glucose metabolism and may increase the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nHow can I better understand my fasting glucose levels?\nFasting glucose is typically measured after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Here are the\u00a0general ranges\u00a0for fasting glucose levels:\n\n\nNormal: &lt;100 mg\/dL\n\nPrediabetes (Impaired Fasting Glucose): 100-125 mg\/dL\n\nDiabetes: 126 mg\/dL or higher on two separate tests\n\nValues above this range may indicate hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), while values below the range may suggest hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Symptoms of high fasting glucose levels include increased thirst and frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow healing of cuts and wounds, and frequent infections. Symptoms of low fasting glucose include hunger, weakness, blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, confusion\/disorientation, dizziness\/lightheadedness, and nausea.\nHow can I maintain optimal fasting glucose levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your fasting glucose levels, consider the following strategies:\nLifestyle and Dietary Adjustments: Adhering to low-carbohydrate diets, getting adequate sleep, engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress effectively can help maintain optimal fasting glucose levels.\nMedical Guidance: Underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hormonal imbalances, and liver or kidney disease can impact fasting glucose levels and require careful management to ensure stability. For individuals with diabetes, adherence to prescribed medications, insulin therapy (if needed), and regular medical follow-ups are crucial for optimal glucose control. Please consult with your physician for guidance in managing health conditions.\nRegular Monitoring and Testing: Regular monitoring of fasting glucose is crucial for individuals with diabetes or those at risk of developing the condition.\u00a0Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems offer a valuable tool for monitoring glucose levels in\u00a0real-time and tracking trends over time. These devices provide immediate feedback on how diet, exercise, medications, and other factors affect blood sugar levels, allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their health management.

Insulin resistance can lead to higher blood sugar levels and is associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic disorders. Learn more about insulin here.\nHOMA-IR is calculated using the fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels from a blood sample. The formula for HOMA-IR is:\nHOMA-IR\u00a0=\u00a0(Fasting\u00a0Insulin\u00a0(\u03bcIU\/ml)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Fasting\u00a0Glucose\u00a0(mg\/dl))\u00a0\/ 405\nThis calculation provides an index that reflects the function of beta cells (which produce insulin) and insulin sensitivity in the body. A higher HOMA-IR score indicates greater insulin resistance.\n\nWhy is HOMA-IR important?\n\nHOMA-IR is crucial for maintaining and assessing metabolic health because it offers a quantifiable measure of insulin resistance, a pivotal factor in numerous metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. By detecting insulin resistance early, HOMA-IR helps clinicians identify at-risk individuals before the manifestation of clinical symptoms, allowing for timely interventions. Additionally, HOMA-IR is valuable for monitoring the progression or remission of metabolic diseases in patients, providing insights into how effectively they are responding to treatment strategies like diet modifications, exercise, or pharmacological interventions. It also aids in tailoring these therapeutic strategies by highlighting the severity of insulin resistance, which can guide the aggressiveness of treatment approaches. Moreover, a high HOMA-IR score can indicate an increased risk of developing diabetes, enabling preventive measures to be put in place. Since insulin resistance\u00a0is often linked with other conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity, HOMA-IR also serves as a comprehensive tool for evaluating an individual\u2019s overall metabolic health and pinpointing multiple risk factors simultaneously.\nHow can I better understand my HOMA-IR levels?\nIn general, a low HOMA-IR value is sought after because it is indicative of low fasting insulin and fasting glucose. While there is no consensus on \u201cnormal\u201d HOMA-IR values yet, here are the generally accepted ranges:\n\n\u00a0&lt;1.0 is considered insulin sensitive (low diabetes risk)\n\n1.5-2.9 may be indicative of insulin resistance (borderline diabetes risk)\n\n2.9&lt; is considered significantly insulin resistant (high diabetes risk).\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: \u22641\nGood: 1.1-1.49\nFair: 1.5-1.99\nPay attention: \u22652\n\nIt is important to discuss your results with a physician if you are concerned with your HOMA-IR value to assess your metabolic health.\nHow can I maintain optimal HOMA-IR levels?\nSince HOMA-IR is a calculation of fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels, some ways to improve these markers include:\nDietary Changes: Mediterranean diets,\u00a0high-protein diets, and\u00a0low-calorie diets\u00a0are among a few interventions that have been shown to reduce HOMA-IR in various studies.\nLifestyle Changes: Whether it is HIIT, moderate-intensity, strength training, or resistance training, studies show that physical activity can significantly reduce HOMA-IR compared to sedentary individuals.

Also known as Lp(a) (pronounced \u201cL-P-little-A\u201d), high levels can\u00a0cause atherosclerosis (plaque-filled arteries) and lead to life-threatening events associated with heart disease such as heart attack and stroke.\u00a0High Lp(a) levels are thus associated with increased cardiovascular risk. According to the\u00a0American Heart Association, about one in five people worldwide have high Lp(a) levels, including 63 million people in the US alone.\nWhy is Lp(a) important?\nUnlike other lipoproteins that are known to be influenced by both genetics and lifestyle, Lp(a) is considered genetically determined\u00a0and not affected by lifestyle changes.\u00a0Some factors may influence Lp(a) levels in some individuals. For example, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and post-menopause may alter Lp(a) levels. A family history of early heart attacks or strokes\u00a0could also\u00a0indicate that your Lp(a) might be elevated. Additionally, individuals of African and South Asian descent are at a higher risk of abnormal Lp(a).\nAccording to the\u00a0CDC, high Lp(a) can cause:\n\ncholesterol deposits, called plaque, to build up in blood vessel walls.\nincreased clotting which can lead to rapidly formed blockages in blood vessels.\nincreased inflammation which can cause plaques to rupture.\n\nHow can I better understand my Lp(a) levels?\nLp(a) is often\u00a0measured\u00a0in either nanomoles per liter (nmol\/L) which is based on the number of particles or milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL) which is based on the mass concentration. Although the latter is often used to measure Lp(a), research suggests that the methodology used to measure the mass concentration may be inaccurate and that the former unit (nmol\/L) is most appropriate. According to the\u00a0American College of Cardiology, there is no reliable conversion factor between the two measurements.\nIn terms of interpreting results, the\u00a0American College of Cardiology\u00a0covers the lack of a generalized consensus across America, Canada, and Europe, with more conservative ranges in Europe as compared to America. To err on the side of caution, since high Lp(a) has been associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, the following ranges from the\u00a0National Library of Medicine\u00a0are a bit more conservative:\n\nOptimal: &lt; 14 mg\/dL\nBorderline risk: 14-30 mg\/dL (30 mg\/dL\u00a0\u2248 75 nmol\/L)\n\nEuropean Atherosclerotic Society\u00a0considers &lt; 30 mg\/dL (&lt; 75 nmol\/L) to be normal\n\n\nHigh risk: 31-50 mg\/dL (50 mg\/dL\u00a0\u2248 125 nmol\/L)\n\nEuropean Atherosclerotic Society\u00a0considers this range to be intermediate risk\n\n\nHighest risk: &gt; 50 mg\/dL\u00a0(50 mg\/dL\u00a0\u2248 125 nmol\/L)\n\n\nEuropean Atherosclerotic Society\u00a0considers this range to be abnormal\n\n\n\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:\n\nOptimal: &lt;50 nmol\/L\nGood: 50-74 nmol\/L\nFair: 75-124 nmol\/L\nPay attention: \u2265125 nmol\/L\n\nHow can I maintain optimal Lp(a) levels?\nLp(a) is considered to be solely impacted by genetics, and research trying to\u00a0elucidate the effects of\u00a0lifestyle changes remains\u00a0inconclusive. However,\u00a0lifestyle may be important to reduce other risk factors associated with atherosclerosis. Best practices for people who are concerned about their heart health, predisposed to heart disease, or who have high Lp(a)\u00a0are to:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Eating a heart-healthy diet can help to reduce atherosclerosis risk. The Mayo Clinic suggests controlling your portion size by eating more low-calorie, nutrient-dense foods (fruits and veggies) and eating less high-calorie, high-sodium, highly processed foods. Additionally, choosing low-fat protein sources (fish, poultry, lean ground meats, and legumes\/soy) and limiting\u00a0unhealthy saturated and trans fats by choosing monounsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil) or polyunsaturated fats (fish, avocados, nuts, seeds) over animal fats, hydrogenated fats, and tropical oils (coconut, palm kernel, palm, cottonseed) can help.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0According to\u00a0Johns Hopkins Medicine, aerobic (\u2265\u00a030 mins\/day, 5 days\/week), resistance\/strength (\u2265 2 nonconsecutive days\/week), and stretching\/flexibility\/balance exercises (daily and before\/after other exercises) can improve heart health. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, getting enough sleep, and stopping tobacco use can improve heart health as well.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nCDC \u2013 Lp(a)\nThe Heart Doctor (video) \u2013 Cardiologist Explains Lp(a)\nAmerican Heart Association (video) \u2013 What is Lp(a)?\nCleveland Clinic \u2013 Lipoprotein (a)\nMedlinePlus \u2013 Lipoprotein (a) Blood Test\nScientific Literature\n\nKronenberg F. 2024.

It plays a crucial role in the body\u2019s waste removal process and can serve as an indicator of liver function and overall health.\nWhy is bilirubin important?\nSiPhox Health includes bilirubin in our Cardiometabolic+ Panel to help monitor and manage testosterone levels. Unconjugated (water-insoluble) bilirubin is bound to albumin, a protein\u00a0that transports it from the bloodstream to the liver. The\u00a0liver\u00a0is responsible for processing unconjugated bilirubin into conjugated (water soluble) bilirubin, which is excreted\u00a0into bile\u00a0before\u00a0leaving the body through urine and feces. The levels of bilirubin in the blood are an important indicator of liver function and health.\nHigh levels of bilirubin can indicate liver dysfunction or diseases such as\u00a0hepatitis, cirrhosis, or bile duct obstruction. High levels of bilirubin in the blood can lead to\u00a0jaundice, a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes. Jaundice can occur in newborns with immature liver function, in adults with liver disease, or in conditions that lead to an increased breakdown of red blood cells.\nMeasuring bilirubin levels is a common part of liver function tests. These tests can help diagnose and monitor liver diseases and conditions that affect bile ducts or the breakdown of red blood cells.\nHow can I better understand my bilirubin levels?\nBilirubin levels are typically reported in milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL) of blood. SiPhox Health measures total bilirubin\u00a0which includes both conjugated and unconjugated forms.\nThe reference ranges for bilirubin are:\n\n\nNormal serum total bilirubin: 0.3-1.0 mg\/dL\n\nCritically high serum total bilirubin: &gt;2.5 mg\/dL\n\nWhen interpreting bilirubin results, higher than normal levels may indicate liver dysfunction, bile duct obstruction, hemolytic anemia, or other underlying health conditions. Elevated bilirubin levels, however, may be benign (harmless). According to a YouTube video by\u00a0Dr. S. Miles, about 10% of the population may have\u00a0Gilbert\u2019s syndrome\u00a0which is a benign elevation in bilirubin. Some studies even indicate that elevated bilirubin may have\u00a0cardioprotective effects\u00a0which could be\u00a0due to its anti-oxidative properties.\nLower than normal bilirubin levels are less common but may suggest certain medications, genetic disorders, or conditions affecting red blood cell production. Additional testing may be required to confirm the diagnosis.\u00a0Cleveland Clinic\u00a0states that low levels of bilirubin generally aren\u2019t a cause for concern.\nHow can I maintain optimal bilirubin levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your bilirubin levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Eating a balanced diet with fiber, meat, dairy, and healthy fats can help in maintaining healthy bilirubin levels.

It measures the amount of nitrogen, a waste product from breaking down proteins, in your blood. When your body processes protein, it creates urea, and your kidneys are responsible for removing this urea from your blood. If your kidneys aren\u2019t working properly, urea can build up in your blood, and the BUN test helps to detect this. However, BUN levels can also be affected by other things like dehydration or certain medications. Doctors usually look at BUN levels alongside other tests to understand how well your kidneys are doing their job and how healthy you are overall.\nWhy is BUN important?\nBUN is an essential marker for assessing kidney function. The kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste products from the blood, including urea. SiPhox Health includes BUN in our Cardiometabolic+ panel to help monitor and manage BUN levels. Higher BUN levels can indicate potential issues with kidney function, while lower levels may suggest liver disease, malnutrition, or overhydration.\nMonitoring BUN levels is vital for\u00a0detecting and managing various health conditions, especially those affecting the kidneys. Elevated BUN levels may signify acute or chronic kidney disease, dehydration, congestive heart failure, urinary tract obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, tissue damage, Addison\u2019s disease, or a high-protein diet. Conversely, low BUN levels can indicate liver damage, malnutrition, a low-protein diet, or overhydration.\nHow can I better understand my BUN levels?\nBUN levels are typically reported in milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL) of blood. Normal BUN levels can vary depending on age, gender, and other factors, but generally fall between 7 to 20 mg\/dL according to a few sources (CDC,\u00a0American Kidney Fund,\u00a0University of Rochester Medical Center).\nMayo Clinic Laboratories\u00a0and\u00a0Cleveland Clinic\u00a0further broke the range down as follows:\n\n1-17 year old males and females: 7-20 mg\/dL\nAdult males: 7-25 mg\/dL\nAdult females: 6-21 mg\/dL\n\nHow can I maintain optimal BUN levels?\nWhile specific interventions may vary depending on the underlying cause of abnormal BUN levels, general strategies for maintaining kidney health include:\nDietary Changes:\u00a0Maintaining a balanced diet by consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help promote kidney health and prevent complications. Additionally, staying hydrated helps support kidney function and maintain BUN within a healthy range.\nLifestyle Changes: Limiting exposure to substances that can harm the kidneys, such as certain medications, toxins, and heavy metals, is essential for kidney health.\nMedical Care: Effectively managing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease can help preserve kidney function and prevent complications.

Regular walking and other forms of movement are associated with numerous benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, weight management, mental well-being, diabetes prevention, and enhanced bone and joint health. For instance, walking helps reduce the risk of heart disease by improving circulation and lowering blood pressure, aids in maintaining a healthy weight, and has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. [1]\nWhile the widely recommended goal of 10,000 steps per day is popular, recent research suggests that fewer steps can still provide substantial health benefits. Studies indicate that even 4,000-5,000 steps daily can lead to improved cardiovascular health and reduced mortality risk, with benefits increasing up to about 7,500 steps per day. A study published in\u00a0JAMA Internal Medicine\u00a0found that older women who took 4,400 steps per day had significantly lower mortality rates compared to those who took fewer steps, with benefits increasing up to about 7,500 steps per day. [2]\nHow can I increase my daily step count?\nIncorporating more steps into your daily routine can be done in creative and unique ways beyond just going for a walk. For example, you can engage in \u201cdeskercise\u201d by incorporating walking or marching in place during work breaks, or by dancing to music to make movement fun and engaging. Active commuting, such as walking or biking to work or school, can also help increase your step count. Other ideas include doing household chores like vacuuming, gardening, and washing the car, taking phone calls or meetings while walking, choosing parking spots further from entrances, using stairs instead of elevators, suggesting walking meetings, exploring new walking routes, and playing with pets or children.\nWearable health trackers like Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Garmin devices have revolutionized how we monitor daily activity. These devices provide real-time data on step count, distance traveled, and calories burned, and allow for personalized goal setting to motivate and track progress. They also offer additional health metrics such as heart rate, sleep quality, and activity intensity, and often include social features for sharing progress and engaging in challenges.\nHow many steps should I aim to take every day?\n\nOptimal: \u2265 8000 steps\nGood: 5000-7999 steps\nFair: 2501-4999 steps\nPay attention: \u2264 2500 steps\n\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nMayo Clinic \u2013 10,000 Steps a Day: Too Low?

High, medium, and low-intensity activities each offer unique benefits that contribute to cardiovascular fitness, weight management, mental health, and overall quality of life.\nHigh-Intensity Activities\nHigh-intensity activities involve vigorous physical exertion that significantly increases your heart rate and breathing. Examples include running, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and competitive sports.\nBenefits:\n\nCardiovascular Health: High-intensity exercises improve heart and lung function, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\nWeight Management: These activities burn a high number of calories in a short amount of time, aiding in weight loss and maintenance.\nMuscle Strength: High-intensity workouts enhance muscle strength and endurance.\nMental Health: They release endorphins, which can boost mood and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nMedium-Intensity Activities\nMedium-intensity activities are moderate forms of exercise that elevate the heart rate and breathing to a moderate level. Examples include brisk walking, dancing, and cycling.\nBenefits:\n\nCardiovascular Fitness: These activities improve heart health and circulation, lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\nWeight Control: Regular medium-intensity exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and body composition.\nFlexibility and Strength: These exercises help maintain and improve muscle tone and joint flexibility.\nMental Well-being: Medium-intensity activities reduce stress and improve overall mood, contributing to better mental health.\n\nLow-Intensity Activities\nLow-intensity activities involve gentle exercises that keep the body moving without causing a significant increase in heart rate. Examples include yoga, stretching, and leisurely walking.\nBenefits:\n\nJoint Health: Low-intensity exercises are gentle on the joints and help maintain mobility and flexibility.\nRecovery: They are excellent for active recovery, helping muscles to recover and reducing the risk of injury from high-intensity workouts.\nStress Reduction: These activities promote relaxation and reduce stress levels, contributing to better mental health.\nEveryday Functionality: Engaging in low-intensity activities helps maintain functional fitness, making daily tasks easier and more manageable.\n\nHow can I incorporate these activities into my routine?\nHigh-Intensity Activities:\n\nInclude 1-3 sessions per week of HIIT or vigorous sports.\nAim for 75 minutes of vigorous activity spread throughout the week.\n\nMedium-Intensity Activities:\n\nAim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, such as brisk walking or cycling.\nIncorporate activities like dancing or swimming into your routine.\n\nLow-Intensity Activities:\n\nInclude daily low-intensity exercises like yoga or stretching routines.\nUse low-intensity activities as a form of active recovery on rest days.\n\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nAmerican Heart Association \u2013 Recommendations for Physical Activity\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\nMayo Clinic \u2013 Exercise Intensity: How to Measure it\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR HEALTH METRICS OR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n\n                    \n                                    \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Sign up and get 10% off your first order\n          Sign up to get offers and the latest information on optimizing your health.\n          \n            \n                \n                Sign up\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n          \n                    \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \n                  \n\n\n        \n          \n            Company\n\n                        \n                        SiPhox, Inc.\n111 Terrace Hall Avenue\nBurlington MA 01803 US\nsupport@siphoxhealth.com\n\n                        \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n            Connect with us\n\n                        \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n\n                                    \n            \n                        Disclaimer\n            \n            \n                        \n              \n                The reference ranges and insights presented in the SiPhox Health dashboard are meant to improve readability and provide context, however you should consult with your physician for a more formal interpretation of your results.

Adequate sleep supports the healing and repair of the heart and blood vessels, helps maintain a healthy balance of hormones, and supports immune function. Good sleep improves brain function, enhancing learning, problem-solving skills, and emotional regulation, while also contributing to better productivity, performance, and safety in daily activities.\nThe amount of sleep needed varies by age. Adults generally require 7-9 hours of sleep per night, teenagers need 8-10 hours, and children need 9-12 hours per night for those aged 6-12, and 10-14 hours for preschoolers. A consistent sleep schedule is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. [1]\nWhat is sleep efficiency?\nSleep efficiency is the ratio of the total time spent asleep to the total time spent in bed, expressed as a percentage. High sleep efficiency (85% or higher) indicates good sleep quality, whereas low sleep efficiency can be a sign of sleep disturbances or insomnia.\nWhat is REM sleep?\nREM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is a stage of sleep characterized by vivid dreaming and increased brain activity. It is essential for cognitive functions such as memory consolidation, learning, and mood regulation.\nWhat is deep sleep?\nDeep sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep, is crucial for physical restoration, growth, and immune function. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscles and tissues, stimulates growth and development, and boosts immune function. [2]\nHow can I improve my sleep?\nTo get enough REM and deep sleep, it is important to establish a routine by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Creating a sleep-conducive environment by keeping the bedroom dark, cool, and quiet, limiting blue light exposure from screens at least an hour before bedtime, exercising regularly, and managing stress through relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing before bed can all help improve sleep quality. [3]\nWearable health trackers like Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Garmin devices provide valuable insights into sleep patterns. These devices can monitor sleep duration, sleep stages, sleep efficiency, and restlessness, helping users identify sleep patterns and potential issues. Tracking these metrics enables individuals to make informed decisions to improve their sleep quality.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation \u2013 What is Sleep Quality?\nHuberman Lab \u2013\u00a0Dr. Matt Walker: The Science &amp; Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep\nCleveland Clinic \u2013\u00a0Sleep: What It Is, Why It\u2019s Important, Stages, REM &amp; NREM\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR METRICS OR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n References[+] \n\nReferences  &#13;\n&#13;\n 1 \nParuthi S, Brooks LJ, D\u2019Ambrosio C, et al.

Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are two crucial metrics that provide insights into cardiovascular health and fitness levels.\nResting heart rate is the number of heartbeats per minute when a person is at rest. It is an indicator of cardiovascular efficiency and overall fitness. A lower RHR typically signifies better cardiovascular fitness and more efficient heart function, while a higher RHR can indicate poor cardiovascular health or higher levels of stress and fatigue.\nHeart rate variability, on the other hand, measures the variation in time between each heartbeat. HRV reflects the autonomic nervous system\u2019s regulation of the heart, indicating how well the body can adapt to stress, recovery, and overall resilience. Higher HRV is generally associated with better cardiovascular fitness, stress resilience, and overall health, while lower HRV can indicate stress, fatigue, or underlying health issues. [1] For resting heart rate, a typical range for adults is 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) [2], with athletes or highly fit individuals often having a resting heart rate as low as 40 bpm. Various factors, including age, fitness level, medication, and temperature, can influence resting heart rate [3]. For heart rate variability, values can vary widely among individuals. Generally, higher HRV indicates better fitness and stress resilience, with values above 100 milliseconds (ms) often seen in highly fit individuals, while lower HRV is common under stress or chronic health conditions.\nHow can I better understand my RHR and HRV?\nA resting heart rate consistently above 100 bpm (tachycardia) or below 60 bpm (bradycardia) in non-athletes can signal potential health issues requiring medical attention.\nRanges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program (RHR):\n\nOptimal: &lt;60 bpm\nGood: 60-70 bpm\nFair: 70-80 bpm\nPay attention: 80-90 bpm\nAlert: 90-100 bpm\n\nElevated RHR increases the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions, while abnormally low RHR can indicate problems such as bradycardia. Low heart rate variability is associated with increased stress, fatigue, and a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, whereas extremely high HRV, although rare, can sometimes indicate overtraining in athletes or other health issues. [4]\nHow can I maintain an optimal RHR and HRV?\nDietary Changes:\u00a0A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains supports cardiovascular health.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Improving both RHR and HRV involves lifestyle changes that enhance cardiovascular fitness and stress management. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming, or cycling, can improve heart function and lower RHR. Stress management techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises can enhance HRV, while adequate sleep is crucial for supporting cardiovascular health and autonomic function. Limiting the intake of stimulants like caffeine and nicotine can also help manage both RHR and HRV. [5]\nWearable health trackers like Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Garmin devices provide advanced features for monitoring heart rate and HRV. These devices offer real-time data and insights into resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and exercise heart rate, helping users identify patterns, monitor their cardiovascular health, and make informed decisions to improve their fitness and well-being.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nHospital for Special Surgery \u2013\u00a0How to Use Heart Rate Variability Data in Your Training\nEuropean Society of Cardiology \u2013\u00a0Guidelines Heart Rate Variability\nAmerican College of Cardiology \u2013\u00a0The Heart Responds Differently to Exercise in Men vs. Women\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR METRICS OR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n References[+] \n\nReferences  &#13;\n&#13;\n 1 https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/blog\/heart-rate-variability-new-way-track-well-2017112212789\n&#13;\n&#13;\n 2 https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/fitness\/expert-answers\/heart-rate\/faq-20057979#:~:text=A%20normal%20resting%20heart%20rate%20for%20adults%20ranges%20from%2060,to%2040%20beats%20per%20minute.\n&#13;\n&#13;\n 3 https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/heart-health\/is-a-low-heart-rate-worrisome\n&#13;\n&#13;\n 4 https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/fitness\/expert-answers\/heart-rate\/faq-20057979#:~:text=Consult%20your%20doctor%20if%20your,dizziness%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath.\n&#13;\n&#13;\n 5 \nGr\u00e4ssler B, Thielmann B, B\u00f6ckelmann I, H\u00f6kelmann A.

One key distinction is between biological aging, which reflects the true wear and tear on our bodies, and chronological aging, simply a count of the years since birth.\nWhat is DNA Methylation?\nA methyl group is a chemical entity composed of one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms. It acts as a fundamental building block in various biological processes and plays a crucial role in DNA methylation. DNA methylation is a biological process that modifies our cellular DNA by adding methyl groups, effectively signaling genes to turn on or off without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This molecular mechanism serves as a regulatory switchboard, modifying the expression of genes, influencing how they function, and affecting various biological processes in the body including the manifestation of various biological traits. Much like adding annotations or post-it notes to a book can alter how we interpret and interact with the text.\nPredicting Biological Age with DNA Methylation\nRecent advances in research have demonstrated that DNA methylation patterns can serve as reliable predictors of biological age. Scientists have developed epigenetic clocks, such as GrimAge, which analyzes specific DNA methylation markers to estimate an individual\u2019s biological age. By scrutinizing thousands of these markers and their correlations, these clocks can accurately assess how an individual\u2019s DNA has aged over time.\nInterpreting GrimAge Results\nReceiving your GrimAge report for SiPhox Health, unveils a personalized snapshot of your biological age journey. A GrimAge lower than your chronological age signifies a promising start on your aging trajectory, indicative of a younger biological age. Percentile rank further contextualizes your results, offering insights into how you fare compared to others of the same chronological age. A percentile rank of 87 on your biological age test, it would mean that your biological age is younger than 87% of others of the same chronological age. By contrast, if you scored 50% or less, that means your biological age is higher than average compared to others of your same chronological age.\nSiPhox Health data shared from a client with permission\nEmbracing the Potential for Change\nPerhaps most compellingly, GrimAge underscores the modifiability of biological age, offering hope in the quest for healthy aging. Armed with insights from GrimAge, individuals can track the impact of lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and anti-aging interventions on their rate of aging. This dynamic approach empowers individuals to take proactive steps in optimizing their health span and lifespan, ultimately shaping a future characterized by vitality and well-being.\nPredicted Telomere Length\nPredicted telomere length is another biomarker used to assess aspects of biological aging, focused specifically on telomere dynamics and cellular aging.\nTelomeres are repetitive DNA sequences found at the ends of chromosomes that protect them from deterioration and fusion with neighboring chromosomes. With each cell division telomeres undergo shortening, serving as crucial markers of cellular aging.\nA notable advancement in telomere length assessment is the DNA methylation-based estimator (DNAmTL), developed by the Horvath lab. This method analyzes blood methylation data from numerous individuals, identifying CpG sites (a specific DNA sequence) whose methylation levels best predict telomere length. DNAmTL surpasses traditional telomere length measurement (LTL) in predicting mortality, heart disease, and age-related conditions. Furthermore, it correlates with lifestyle factors like diet, physical activity, and smoking.\nImproving Your DNA Methylation Results\nThere are several ways individuals can improve their DNA methylation results and promote healthy aging. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and stress management play critical roles in shaping DNA methylation patterns. Similarly, smoking has been linked to decreased methylation. However, quitting smoking has been shown to reverse this effect, leading to increased methylation. This reversal suggests that former smokers can eventually exhibit gene expression levels comparable to those of non-smokers through cessation. [1] [2]\nIn conclusion, DNA methylation analysis offers a powerful tool for predicting biological age and assessing individual health risks. By understanding and interpreting DNA methylation results, individuals can take proactive steps to improve their health span and enhance their quality of life.\n References[+] \n\nReferences  &#13;\n&#13;\n 1 Abraham, M.

Its levels follow a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning and declining by evening.\nCortisol aids in managing physical and psychological stress. Chronic high cortisol levels can lead to serious health issues related to inflammation and cardiovascular health, while low levels may indicate adrenal insufficiency.\nRegular at-home testing of cortisol can detect abnormal levels early, helping prevent potential health issues. SiPhox Health offers convenient testing kits to monitor cortisol along with other important health markers.\n\n\n\n    When stress is short-lived, the onset of atrophy is reversible, but long-term stress can lead to the death of neurons located in the hippocampus. [2]\n\n\nWhat is cortisol?\nCortisol is a hormone synthesized and secreted by the adrenal glands of the kidneys that plays a major role in regulating stress, metabolism, and immunity.\n\n\u201cAdrenal Disorders.\u201d Baylor College of Medicine, www.bcm.edu\/healthcare\/specialties\/endocrinology\/endocrinology-diabetes-and-metabolism\/adrenal-disorders. Accessed 3 May 2024.\n\n\nIt follows a\u00a0diurnal rhythm affected by sleep- naturally rising in the early morning and falling in the evening.\n\n\n\n\u201cDiurnal Cortisol Curves.\u201d ZRT Laboratory, www.zrtlab.com\/landing-pages\/diurnal-cortisol-curves\/. Accessed 3 May 2024.\nAlthough cortisol is ultimately secreted by the kidneys, it all starts in the brain\u2014 more specifically, the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a part of the brain that bridges the gap between the nervous system (thoughts and sensations traveling between the brain, spinal cord, and nerves) and the endocrine system (hormones secreted by glands). In doing so, it helps maintain homeostasis within the body by regulating phenomena such as body temperature, heart rate, hunger, mood, sleep, thirst, etc. through the modulation of hormones. [3]\nLike many hormones, the secretion of cortisol involves a few steps. The hypothalamus secretes a hormone that prompts the anterior pituitary gland to secrete a hormone that signals the adrenal glands to secrete cortisol. This cross-communication is called the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis.\n\n\u201cCortisol | You and Your Hormones from the Society of Endocrinology.\u201d You and Your Hormones, Jan. 2019, www.yourhormones.info\/hormones\/cortisol\/.\n\nIt all seems complicated because it is! The fascinating complexity of the human body allows for fine-tuned regulation of important responses and integration between different systems (neurological and hormonal).\nHow is stress related to cortisol?\nA stress response can result from any physical or psychological stimulus (stressor) that disrupts the body\u2019s homeostasis. [4] Cortisol helps the body manage stress by maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure, regulating metabolism, and suppressing non-essential functions (like the immune system) to focus resources on dealing with the stressor. While stress is important in moderation to motivate us through our day-to-day activities, excessive amounts can be detrimental and lead to long-term health implications such as the development of coronary heart disease, for example. [5]\n\n\nHigh cortisol levels are an indicator of acute (sudden), chronic (long-term), and\/or traumatic (life-threatening) stress. Secondary factors associated with mental stress include alcohol drinking, smoking, a lack of exercise, inadequate sleep, and poor nutrition. Over time, prolonged high levels of cortisol (Cushing\u2019s disease or hypercortisolism) can lead to weight gain, fat redistribution, poor sleep, a lowered immune system, and increased inflammation. High cortisol levels can also inhibit testosterone secretion due to stress-related suppression. Elevated levels of cortisol in older adults have been linked to higher levels of psychosocial stress, poorer cognitive performance, and atrophy of memory-related structures in the brain. [6]\nOn the flip side, low levels of cortisol might indicate poor adrenal function or Addison\u2019s disease. This could lead to symptoms including fatigue, unintentional weight loss, poor appetite, and hypotension. [7]\nThe Importance of Cortisol Testing\nBecause of cortisol\u2019s widespread effects on a variety of important physiological areas (inflammation, immunity, metabolism, cardiovascular health, cognitive fitness, etc.), testing cortisol can help to identify potential issues before they progress. With SiPhox Health\u2019s frequent testing capabilities, you can monitor your own cortisol levels (along with 16 other markers of inflammation, metabolic, hormonal, and cardiovascular health) to ensure they are within normal physiological range and catch abnormalities.\nNormal serum cortisol ranges for adults: [8]\n\nPeaks in the morning between 6 am \u2013 8 am: 10-20 ug\/dL\nFalls in the evening around 4 pm: 3-10 ug\/dL\n\nWhile levels in the lower range are better for inflammation, morning cortisol levels under 3 ug\/dL may indicate adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol levels consistently above the normal range may indicate Cushing\u2019s disease which could point towards the presence of tumors. Keep in mind that certain medications can alter cortisol production, so it is important to talk to your doctor if you are concerned with your levels. [9]\nA 3-point cortisol test, often referred to as a \u201cdiurnal cortisol test,\u201d measures cortisol levels at three different times of the day to assess the adrenal gland\u2019s function and the body\u2019s stress response.\u00a0Although it is expected to see natural variations, atypically high or low results\u00a0at these specific times\u00a0may indicate an adrenal gland disorder.\u00a0Because saliva is convenient to collect, the 3-point salivary cortisol test may be more beneficial for those who are looking to confirm the presence of abnormalities or underlying diseases through repeat testing throughout the day compared to a blood test.\nUltimately, the\u00a0main difference between the saliva and blood tests is that the three-point test is more diagnostic in nature, especially for conditions that affect cortisol rhythm, while the fingerprick test is more suited for general monitoring.\nWhat lifestyle changes can help regulate my cortisol levels?\nIf your cortisol levels are on the\u00a0higher\u00a0side, studies suggests the following interventions may help\u00a0with regulation:\n\nHerbs and natural supplements such as\u00a0ashwagandha [10], Rhodiola [11], lemon balm [12], and chamomile [13]\n\nAim for 8 hours of restful\u00a0sleep (avoid caffeine after midday [14], wear blue-light blocking glasses [15], put the\u00a0screens away before bed [16])\nSpend more time in nature [17]\n\nPractice yoga, tai chi, qi gong, and other\u00a0mindfulness meditation and breathing exercises [18]\n\nFoods such as dark chocolate, garlic, fermented foods (kimchi, yogurt), and plants high in vitamin C (oranges, broccoli) [19]\n\nSurround yourself with\u00a0healthy relationships [20]\u00a0(pets are a plus!

As\u00a0Dr. Peter Attia, a leading expert on preventative health, says, \u201cWe eat, make, store, and excrete it.\u201d\u00a0While abnormal cholesterol levels are frequently attributed to diet, only\u00a020-30%\u00a0of our circulating levels are obtained from food. Most of the cholesterol in our body is synthesized, and although cholesterol is healthy for the body in the right amounts, excessive or insufficient levels can be indicative of\u00a0critical issues.\nWhy is cholesterol important?\nCholesterol\u00a0is processed in the liver, but\u00a0too much (hyperlipidemia) can cause atherosclerosis (plaque buildup within arteries) and eventually lead to cardiovascular events such as heart disease or stroke. On the other hand, the less common but still prevalent\u00a0hypolipidemia\u00a0(abnormally low levels of lipids) may indicate the presence of other underlying disorders.\nHow can I better understand my cholesterol levels?\nTo better understand your test results, here are some values to reference:\n\nVery low: &lt; 125 mg\/dL\nLow: 125-160 mg\/dL\nOptimal: 160-200 mg\/dL\n\nAt risk: 200-240 mg\/dL\n\nDangerous: &gt; 240 mg\/dL\n\nIf you are concerned with any of your results, it is important to consult with your physician.\nHow can I maintain optimal cholesterol levels?\nDietary Changes:\u00a0The\u00a0Mediterranean diet, as well as heart-healthy\u00a0plant-based diets, have been shown to lower cholesterol and cardiovascular risk. Increasing fruit and vegetable intake as well as consuming more soluble fiber (oats, legumes) can improve cholesterol levels. Additionally, reducing dietary cholesterol and saturated fat can reduce high cholesterol levels.\nLifestyle Changes: Exercising regularly, avoiding smoking and tobacco products, maintaining a healthy weight, and regulating high blood pressure and high blood sugar can aid in regulating cholesterol levels. Additionally, managing stress and limiting alcohol consumption can help.\nLow cholesterol\u00a0is typically either caused by a genetic disorder (primary cause) or another peripheral disorder (secondary cause) such as anemia, cancer, hepatitis C, malabsorption, hyperthyroidism, or undernutrition. As a result, hypolipidemia may be more difficult to\u00a0target through lifestyle interventions.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nAmerican Heart Association\u2019s Guide to Cholesterol\nPeter Attia\u2019s series with Tom Dayspring, M.D., expert in lipidology\nScientific Literature\n\nJanse Van Rensburg WJ.

Imagine each section of DNA as a recipe in a cookbook. Methylation is like a note added to a recipe page, suggesting when and how often the recipe should be used. This process plays a critical role in various biological processes, including development, aging, and the regulation of gene expression.\nHow can DNA methylation predict biological age?\nOur biological age, which may differ from our chronological age, gives a more accurate picture of our health and longevity. Scientists have discovered that measuring DNA methylation can predict biological age very accurately. This is based on the \u201cepigenetic clock,\u201d a method that analyzes the methylation levels of specific DNA sites. These changes in methylation patterns over time correlate with aging, allowing scientists to estimate the biological age of a person, which can reflect their overall health status more accurately than just the number of years they have lived.\nWhy is understanding your DNA methylation important?\nUnderstanding your DNA methylation levels can provide insights into your biological age, which is a powerful indicator of overall health, disease risk, and longevity. It can help identify if your body is aging faster than it should be, potentially due to lifestyle choices, environmental factors, or genetic predispositions. This knowledge allows for early intervention and personalized lifestyle modifications to improve health outcomes and possibly extend lifespan.\nHow can I interpret my DNA methylation results?\nWhen you receive your DNA methylation test results from\u00a0SiPhox Health, you\u2019ll get an estimate of your biological age. If your biological age is significantly lower than your chronological age, it suggests a healthy lifestyle and potentially lower risk for age-related diseases. Conversely, if your biological age is higher, it may indicate a higher risk for certain conditions or that your body is under more stress than is typical for your chronological age. These results are a powerful motivator for adopting healthier habits.\nHow can I improve my DNA methylation results?\nImproving your DNA methylation patterns and, consequently, your biological age, is possible through lifestyle changes and interventions.\nDietary Changes:\u00a0A colorful diet rich in fruits, vegetables, seeds, and lean proteins can positively influence methylation patterns. Foods high in folate, vitamin B12, and polyphenols are particularly beneficial.\nLifestyle Changes: Regular exercise has been shown to positively affect DNA methylation, contributing to a healthier biological age. Chronic stress can negatively impact methylation patterns. Stress-reducing practices such as mindfulness, meditation, and yoga can help. Avoiding environmental toxins such as smoke, pollution, and certain chemicals can help prevent their adverse effects on DNA methylation. Quality sleep is crucial for maintaining healthy methylation patterns.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nCDC \u2013 What is Epigenetics?\nUniversity of Glasgow \u2013 Most accurate test to date developed to measure biological aging\nScientific literature for further reading\n\nAanes, H., Bleka, \u00d8., Dahlberg, P.S. et al.\u00a0A new blood based epigenetic age predictor for adolescents and young adults.\u00a0Sci Rep\u00a013, 2303 (2023).\u00a0\nJylh\u00e4v\u00e4 J, Pedersen NL, H\u00e4gg S.

Serving a critical role in the menstrual cycle,\u00a0progesterone fluctuates, peaking during the luteal phase (after ovulation) and declining before menstruation. Normal\u00a0levels are necessary for regular menstrual cycles, fertility, embryo implantation, and pregnancy maintenance. In addition to its role in reproductive health, this hormone also influences mood, sleep, and overall well-being.\nWhy is progesterone important?\nProgesterone plays a critical role in numerous physiological processes, making it essential for maintaining overall health. SiPhox Health includes progesterone in both our Fertility+ Panel and Hormone+ and Fertility Panel for women to help monitor and manage progesterone levels. Inadequate progesterone levels in the United States can cause menstrual irregularities, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. According to the Cleveland Clinic, maintaining balanced progesterone levels is crucial for reproductive health and overall well-being.\nHow can I better understand my progesterone levels?\nProgesterone levels in females are typically measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng\/mL) of blood. Normal progesterone levels vary depending on the menstrual cycle phase, pregnancy status, and individual health factors.\nThe\u00a0American Board of Internal Medicine\u00a0defines normal progesterone levels as:\n\nFemale (follicular phase): 0.02 \u2013 0.9 ng\/mL\nFemale (luteal phase): 2 \u2013 30 ng\/mL\nMale (adult): 0.12 \u2013 0.3 ng\/mL\n\nLower than normal progesterone levels\u00a0may occur during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle or in conditions such as anovulation (absence of ovulation), luteal phase defect, or certain hormonal disorders. Additional testing and medical evaluation are essential to identify the underlying cause and determine appropriate management.\nHigher than normal progesterone levels may occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or pregnancy. Elevated levels\u00a0do not typically negatively impact health. In non-pregnant individuals, elevated progesterone levels may indicate conditions such as ovarian cysts, adrenal disorders, or certain medications. Further evaluation by a healthcare provider is necessary to determine the underlying cause.\nHow can I maintain optimal progesterone levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your progesterone levels consider the following strategies:\nDietary Changes: Both\u00a0macronutrient\u00a0and\u00a0mineral\u00a0intake may affect progesterone levels.\u00a0Cleveland Clinic suggests that foods rich in zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B, and magnesium may help support healthy progesterone levels.

It is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body. Zinc also plays a vital role in immune function, taste and smell, and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Zinc is naturally present in various foods, including meat, shellfish, dairy products, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains, and can be taken as a dietary supplement if necessary. [1]\n\n\n\n\nWhy is zinc important?\n\n\n\n\nZinc is important because it plays a fundamental role in numerous physiological functions critical to human health. It is a key component of over 300 enzymes involved in metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is essential for a properly functioning immune system, helping to protect the body against infections and facilitating wound healing. It also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Additionally, zinc is necessary for maintaining the senses of taste and smell, as well as contributing to the structural integrity of proteins and cell membranes, which protects cells from oxidative damage. Its involvement in these vital processes makes zinc crucial for maintaining overall health and preventing various deficiencies and disorders.\u00a0SiPhox Health\u00a0includes zinc in our Mineral Panel to monitor and manage zinc status.\nHow can I better understand my zinc levels?\nTo assist in interpreting results, various health organizations and labs outline ranges that indicate normal levels of zinc in the blood. These ranges often differ slightly from each other. ZRT Laboratory has a list of Heavy Metals &amp; Essential Elements Reference Ranges which can be found\u00a0here.\nAccording to ZRT Laboratory, the normal range for zinc is\u00a05.06-8.57 mg\/L.\n\n\n\n\nIf zinc levels are too low, it can lead to a variety of health issues, including impaired immune function, which makes the body more susceptible to infections. Other symptoms of zinc deficiency include growth retardation in children, delayed sexual maturation, hair loss, diarrhea, eye and skin lesions, and loss of appetite. Zinc deficiency can also impair wound healing and cause cognitive and motor function issues. Conversely, excessively high zinc levels can be toxic and cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and headaches. Chronic high intake of zinc can interfere with the absorption and metabolism of other essential minerals, particularly copper, leading to copper deficiency and associated problems like anemia and weakened immune function. Therefore, maintaining balanced zinc levels is essential for overall health and well-being.\n\n\n\n\nHow can I maintain optimal zinc levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your zinc levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Sources:\u00a0Incorporate zinc-rich foods into your diet, such as meat, shellfish, dairy products, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. According to the\u00a0National Institute of Health, a single serving of oysters contains more than the recommended daily intake for zinc. According to the\u00a0NIH, \u201clow zinc status has been observed in 30% to 50% of people with alcohol use disorder\u201c.\nSupplementation:\u00a0If dietary intake is insufficient, zinc supplements can help. Excessive zinc intake can lead to toxicity, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches, and long-term high doses can interfere with copper absorption, causing copper deficiency.

It plays a crucial role in iron metabolism, the formation of red blood cells, and the maintenance of healthy bones, blood vessels, nerves, and immune function. Copper is also important for brain development and connective tissue formation. It is naturally present in various foods, including beef liver, shellfish, nuts, seeds, whole grains, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables, and can be taken as a dietary supplement if necessary.\nWhy is copper important?\nDue to copper\u2019s role in numerous physiological processes, maintaining adequate copper levels is essential. SiPhox Health includes copper in our Mineral Panel to help monitor and manage copper status. Inadequate copper levels in the United States are primarily caused by genetic disorders and malabsorption issues and can lead to anemia, cardiovascular abnormalities, bone defects, and compromised immune function. On the other hand, while the body is quite efficient at expelling excessive copper, excessive copper intake can cause toxicity, leading to gastrointestinal distress, liver damage, and neurological symptoms. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, in some studies, copper imbalances have been tied to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\nHow can I better understand my copper levels?\nTo assist in interpreting results, various health organizations and labs outline ranges that indicate normal levels of copper in the blood. These ranges often differ slightly from each other. ZRT Laboratory has a list of Heavy Metals &amp; Essential Elements Reference Ranges which can be found here.\nAccording to ZRT Laboratory, the normal range for copper is 0.64-1.10 mg\/L.\nLow levels of copper may be caused by poor dietary intake, malabsorption, or genetic conditions like Menkes disease. High levels can result from excessive dietary intake, supplementation, or genetic conditions like Wilson\u2019s disease.\nHow can I maintain optimal copper levels?\nIf you need to maintain or adjust your copper levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Sources: Incorporate copper-rich foods into your diet, such as beef liver, shellfish, dark unsweetened chocolate, nuts, seeds, whole grains, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables. According to the National Institute of Health, a single serving of shellfish, such as oysters, provides a significant amount of the recommended daily intake for copper.\nSupplementation: If dietary intake is insufficient, copper supplements can help. It is essential to consult with your healthcare provider for the appropriate dosage, as excessive copper supplementation can lead to toxicity. Additionally, due to the importance of maintaining a balance between the amount of copper and zinc in your body, a zinc supplement must be taken along with copper. Due to this, it is possible to develop a copper or zinc deficiency by taking one of these supplements without the other since they can block the absorption of the other mineral in the small intestine.\nLifestyle Changes: If your copper levels are high, avoid sources of excess copper, such as drinking water from copper pipes and using copper cookware.

It is widely recognized for its harmful effects on the nervous, digestive, and immune systems, as well as the lungs, kidneys, skin, and eyes. Mercury exposure occurs primarily through consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish, occupational exposure, and use of mercury-containing products. [1]\nWhy is mercury important?\nMercury is highly toxic, particularly to the nervous system. High levels of mercury can lead to neurological and behavioral disorders, and long-term exposure can cause severe kidney damage. Pregnant women and young children are particularly vulnerable to mercury toxicity, which can impair fetal and child development. Additionally, mercury has the ability to accumulate over time in animals, including humans, which means that small amounts of mercury have the potential to be as harmful as an exposure to a significant\u00a0amount\u00a0of mercury at once.\u00a0SiPhox Health\u00a0includes mercury in our Mineral Panel to monitor and reduce the risk of mercury exposure.\nHow can I better understand my mercury levels?\nTo assist in interpreting results, various health organizations and labs outline ranges that indicate normal levels of magnesium in the blood. These ranges often differ slightly from each other. ZRT Laboratory has a list of Heavy Metals &amp; Essential Elements Reference Ranges which can be found\u00a0here.\nAccording to ZRT Laboratory, the normal range for magnesium is &lt;6.98 \u00b5g\/L.\nElevated mercury levels are typically caused by dietary sources (particularly fish and shellfish), occupational exposure, and certain traditional medicines. Reducing intake of high-mercury fish and improving workplace safety can help lower mercury exposure.\nHow can I reduce mercury exposure?\nTo reduce mercury exposure, consider the following strategies:\nAvoid Mercury-Containing Products: Be cautious with products that contain mercury, such as some batteries, thermometers, and fluorescent bulbs.\nDietary Changes: Limit consumption of high-mercury fish such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Instead, opt for fish lower in mercury such as salmon, cod, sardines, and trout.

It also plays a role in thyroid hormone metabolism and immune function. Selenium is found in foods such as nuts (particularly Brazil nuts), seafood, meat, eggs, and grains. [1]\nWhy is selenium important?\nSelenium is crucial for the functioning of several enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, which protects cells from damage. It also supports immune system function, thyroid health, and reproductive health.\u00a0As a result, selenium has been hypothesized to play a role\u00a0against cancer, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, and cognitive decline.\u00a0SiPhox Health\u00a0includes selenium in our Mineral Panel due to its significant role in these areas. Both selenium deficiency and excess can lead to health problems, including heart disease, thyroid dysfunction, and weakened immune response.\nHow can I better understand my selenium levels?\nTo assist in interpreting results, various health organizations and labs outline ranges that indicate normal levels of magnesium in the blood. These ranges often differ slightly from each other. ZRT Laboratory has a list of Heavy Metals &amp; Essential Elements Reference Ranges which can be found\u00a0here.\nAccording to ZRT Laboratory, the normal range for selenium is 130-362 ug\/L.\nSelenium deficiency can be caused by poor dietary intake, certain diseases, and gastrointestinal conditions that impair nutrient absorption. Excessive selenium intake, often from supplements, can lead to toxicity, resulting in symptoms like gastrointestinal distress, hair loss, and neurological damage.\nHow can I maintain optimal selenium levels?\nTo maintain your selenium levels, consider these strategies:\nAlcohol:\u00a0Alcohol\u00a0intake is associated with lower levels of certain vitamins and minerals, including selenium.\u00a0Read more\u00a0here.\nDietary Sources: Incorporate selenium-rich foods such as Brazil nuts, seafood, meat, eggs, and grains into your diet.\u00a0According to the\u00a0National Institute of Health, a single ounce of Brazil nuts contains 544 micrograms of selenium (that\u2019s 989% of an adult\u2019s daily value)!\nSupplementation: If dietary intake is insufficient, selenium supplements can help.

It is not essential for human health and can cause severe damage if accumulated in the body. Cadmium exposure most often occurs through the inhalation of cigarette smoke and the ingestion of contaminated food and water. Chronic exposure to cadmium can lead to kidney damage, bone demineralization, and increased risk of cancer. [1]\nWhy is cadmium important?\nDue to its toxic nature, prolonged cadmium exposure can have severe health implications, including kidney dysfunction, osteoporosis, and respiratory issues. It is also a known carcinogen, increasing the risk of lung, prostate, and kidney cancer.\u00a0SiPhox Health\u00a0includes cadmium in our\u00a0Mineral Panel to monitor and mitigate the risk of cadmium-related health issues.\nHow can I better understand my cadmium levels?\nTo assist in interpreting results, various health organizations and labs outline ranges that indicate normal levels of cadmium in the blood. These ranges often differ slightly from each other.\u00a0ZRT Laboratory has a list of Heavy Metals &amp; Essential Elements Reference Ranges which can be found\u00a0here.\nAccording to ZRT Laboratory, the normal range for cadmium is\u00a0&lt;0.75 \u00b5g\/L.\nHigh cadmium levels are typically caused by occupational exposure, smoking, and consumption of contaminated food or water. Reducing exposure is crucial for minimizing health risks.\nHow can I reduce cadmium exposure?\nTo reduce cadmium exposure, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Adjustments: Avoid foods known to be high in cadmium, such as shellfish, liver, and kidney meats.

It follows a\u00a0diurnal rhythm that is affected by sleep- naturally rising in the early morning, peaking around 30 minutes after waking up, and\u00a0subsequently falling in the evening.\n\n\nWhy is cortisol important?\nHigh cortisol levels are an indicator of\u00a0acute (sudden), chronic (long-term), and\/or\u00a0traumatic (life-threatening) stress.\u00a0Secondary factors associated with mental stress include alcohol drinking, smoking, a lack of exercise, inadequate sleep, and poor nutrition.\u00a0Over time, prolonged high levels of cortisol (Cushing\u2019s disease or hypercortisolism) can lead to weight gain, fat redistribution, poor sleep, a lowered immune system, and increased inflammation. Low levels might indicate poor adrenal function or Addison\u2019s disease.\nHow can I better understand my fingerprick cortisol levels?\nNormal serum cortisol ranges:\n\nPeaks in the morning between 6 am \u2013 8 am: 10-15 ug\/dL\nFalls in the evening around 4 pm: 4-10 ug\/dL\n\nWhile levels in the lower range are better for inflammation, morning cortisol levels under\u00a03 ug\/dL\u00a0may indicate adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol levels consistently\u00a0above the normal range may indicate Cushing\u2019s disease which could\u00a0point towards the presence of tumors. Keep in mind that certain medications can\u00a0alter cortisol production, so it is important to talk to your doctor if you are concerned with your levels.\nHow does a 3-Point Saliva test differ?\nThe three-point cortisol test involves collecting saliva at three different times of the day (morning, afternoon, and night). Although it is expected to see natural variations, atypically high or low results\u00a0at these specific times\u00a0may indicate an adrenal gland disorder.\u00a0Because saliva is convenient to collect, the 3-point salivary cortisol test may be more beneficial for those who are looking to confirm the presence of abnormalities or underlying diseases through repeat testing throughout the day.\nUltimately, the\u00a0main difference between the saliva and blood tests is that the three-point test is more diagnostic in nature, especially for conditions that affect cortisol rhythm, while the fingerprick test is more suited for general monitoring.\nHow can I maintain optimal cortisol levels?\nIf your cortisol levels are on the\u00a0higher side, studies suggest the following interventions may help\u00a0with regulation:\nDietary Changes: Including herbs and natural supplements such as\u00a0ashwagandha, rhodiola,\u00a0lemon balm, and\u00a0chamomile can help to reduce cortisol. Foods such as dark chocolate, garlic, fermented foods (kimchi, yogurt), and plants high in vitamin C (oranges, broccoli) can help as well.\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0Aim for 8 hours of restful\u00a0sleep\u00a0(avoid\u00a0caffeine\u00a0after midday, wear blue-light blocking\u00a0glasses, put the\u00a0screens\u00a0away before bed), and spend more time in\u00a0nature to lower your cortisol levels. Practicing yoga, tai chi, qi gong, and other mindfulness meditation exercises and surrounding\u00a0yourself with\u00a0healthy relationships\u00a0(pets are a plus!) can help as well.\nIf your cortisol levels are on the\u00a0lower side,\u00a0studies suggest the following interventions may help\u00a0with regulation:\nLifestyle Changes:\u00a0High-intensity\u00a0exercise and consuming caffeine can help to increase cortisol levels.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nCleveland Clinic \u2013 Cortisol\nCleveland Clinic \u2013 How to Reduce Cortisol and Turn Down the Dial on Stress\nHuberman Lab Video\/Podcast \u2013 Tools for Managing Stress and Anxiety\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n\n                    \n                                    \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Sign up and get 10% off your first order\n          Sign up to get offers and the latest information on optimizing your health.\n          \n            \n                \n                Sign up\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n          \n                    \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \n                  \n\n\n        \n          \n            Company\n\n                        \n                        SiPhox, Inc.\n111 Terrace Hall Avenue\nBurlington MA 01803 US\nsupport@siphoxhealth.com\n\n                        \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n            Connect with us\n\n                        \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                            \n                            \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n\n                                    \n            \n                        Disclaimer\n            \n            \n                        \n              \n                The reference ranges and insights presented in the SiPhox Health dashboard are meant to improve readability and provide context, however you should consult with your physician for a more formal interpretation of your results.

It serves as a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions, playing a crucial role in energy production, protein synthesis, DNA and RNA synthesis, and the regulation of muscle and nerve functions. Magnesium is also integral to maintaining healthy bone structure, supporting cardiovascular health by regulating blood pressure, and aiding in blood glucose control. It is naturally present in a variety of foods, including leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes, and can also be taken as a dietary supplement to ensure adequate intake and overall health. [1]\nWhy is magnesium important?\nDue to magnesium\u2019s role in improving bone health, treating migraines,\u00a0assisting with neurological pathways (and its potential link to mood disorders), regulating blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk, and supporting enzymes that modulate blood sugar and insulin regulation (and potentially mitigating Type 2 Diabetes risk),\u00a0SiPhox Health\u00a0includes magnesium in our Mineral Panel.\u00a0Inadequate magnesium levels can lead to various health issues, including muscle cramps, fatigue, and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Maintaining adequate magnesium levels is crucial for overall health and well-being.\nHow can I better understand my magnesium levels?\nTo assist in interpreting results, various health organizations and labs outline ranges that indicate normal levels of magnesium in the blood. These ranges often differ slightly from each other. ZRT Laboratory has a list of Heavy Metals &amp; Essential Elements Reference Ranges which can be found\u00a0here.\nAccording to ZRT Laboratory, the normal range for magnesium is 29-51 mg\/L.\nLow levels of magnesium may be caused by factors such as poor dietary intake, gastrointestinal diseases, chronic alcoholism, and certain medications. High levels are less common but can occur due to excessive supplementation or kidney dysfunction.\nHow can I maintain optimal magnesium levels?\nIf you need to maintain or increase your magnesium levels, consider the following strategies:\nDietary Sources: Incorporate magnesium-rich foods into your diet, such as leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes. According to the\u00a0National Institute of Health, a single ounce of pumpkin seeds or chia seeds contains over 100 milligrams (156 mg and 111 mg, respectively)!\u00a0Approximately 30% to 40% of the dietary magnesium consumed is typically absorbed by the body.\nLifestyle Changes: There is a link between alcohol consumption and magnesium deficiency, especially in those who may chronically abuse alcohol [2]. Several studies on stress and magnesium show that extended periods of stress result in progressive magnesium deficit. [3]\nSupplementation: If dietary intake is insufficient, magnesium supplements can help. According to the\u00a0NIH, \u201cmagnesium in the aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms is absorbed more completely and is more bioavailable than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate. One study found that very high doses of zinc from supplements (142 mg\/day) can interfere with magnesium absorption and disrupt the magnesium balance in the body\u201d. Calcium may also compete with magnesium for absorption if calcium concentrations are much higher than that of magnesium (here is an interesting blog on the topic).\u00a0The Recommended Dietary Allowance differs with age, sex, pregnancy, and lactation, so consult with your healthcare provider for the appropriate dosage.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nNational Institutes of Health \u2013 Magnesium\nThe Nutrition Source \u2013 Magnesium\nHealth Direct\u00a0\u2013 Magnesium and your health\n\nDISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.\n References[+] \n\nReferences  &#13;\n&#13;\n 1 Al Alawi, Abdullah M et al. \u201cMagnesium and Human Health: Perspectives and Research Directions.\u201d International journal of endocrinology vol. 2018 9041694. 16 Apr. 2018, doi:10.1155\/2018\/9041694\n&#13;\n&#13;\n 2 Rivlin RS.

In addition to his scientific research, Andrew Huberman has gained popularity for sharing his knowledge and insights on various platforms, such as podcasts, YouTube, and social media. He is the host of the \u201cHuberman Lab Podcast,\u201d where he discusses neuroscience, health, and human performance. Cortisol is one of the biomarkers that Andrew Huberman references frequently in his long-form health optimization episodes on sleep, energy, mood, and hormonal balance. Below are the highlights of Huberman on what role cortisol levels play in your body and how to biohack them.\nWhat is cortisol?\nCortisol is a steroid hormone derived from cholesterol and produced by the adrenal glands, involved in stress response, metabolism, inflammation regulation, blood pressure control, and immune function. Managing cortisol levels is crucial to avoid health issues linked to chronic stress and maintain overall well-being.\n\n\n    In the Huberman Lab Podcast #18, Andrew Huberman explains that cortisol and adrenaline are essential hormones that regulate our energy levels, focus, and immune system function. He emphasizes that these hormones are not inherently good or bad, but rather their regulation is crucial. Huberman states, \u201cThey\u2019re terrific when they\u2019re regulated, they are terrible when they\u2019re misregulated.\u201d\n\n\nWhat does cortisol do and how does it relate to your circadian rythm?\nCortisol plays several specific roles in the body:\n1. Stress response\n2. Glucose metabolism\n3. Anti-inflammatory properties\n4. Blood pressure regulation\n5. Immune function modulation\n\n\n    In his podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that cortisol is a hormone that is released in the morning to wake us up and stimulate movement. He emphasizes that \u201ccortisol is not necessarily a stress hormone, but rather a hormone of energy.\u201d\n\n\nThis is why it\u2019s linked to wakefulness and circadian rythm.\n\n\n    \u201cSo the first tool is to make sure that your highest levels of cortisol are first thing in the morning when you wake up. One way or another, every 24 hours, you will get an increase in cortisol. That is non-negotiable. That is written into your genome. That increase in cortisol is there to wake you up and to make you alert.\u201d\n\n\nCortisol levels naturally vary throughout the day, following a pattern called the cortisol awakening response (CAR), which is closely related to the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is the body\u2019s internal 24-hour clock that regulates various physiological processes, including sleep, metabolism, and hormone production.\nCortisol levels are typically lowest around midnight and start to increase in the early morning hours before waking. They reach their peak approximately 30 minutes after.\nHuberman on Biohacking your Cortisol 3 waking up, which is known as the cortisol awakening response. This peak in cortisol levels helps to jumpstart the body and provide energy for the day. After this peak, cortisol levels gradually decline throughout the day, reaching their lowest levels in the evening, which facilitates relaxation and sleep.\n\nDisruptions to the natural cortisol pattern can negatively impact overall health and wellbeing. Factors such as stress, jet lag, shift work, and exposure to artificial light at night can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cortisol secretion patterns. In the context of biohacking and health optimization, it is essential to maintain a balanced circadian rhythm and cortisol pattern. Strategies include maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule, getting exposure to natural sunlight during the day, reducing stress, and avoiding exposure to blue light from electronic devices in the evening.\n\n\n    In his podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that cortisol is a hormone that is released in the morning to wake us up and stimulate movement. He emphasizes that cortisol is not necessarily a stress hormone, but rather a hormone of energy. According to Dr. Huberman, cortisol and adrenaline are not inherently good or bad, but rather their effects depend on their regulation and timing of release. He suggests that chronic stress can lead to a cascade of stress and negative effects on the body.\n\n\nCortisol\u2019s relationship to testosterone and estrogen\nExcess Cortisol not only increases stress levels and makes it difficult to sleep, but it can also decrease your sex hormone levels, as Huberman points out:\nBut seldom is it discussed how sleep actually adjusts things like testosterone and estrogen. And it does it by modifying cortisol. So the molecule cholesterol can be converted into testosterone or estrogen, but there\u2019s a competition whereby the cholesterol will turn into cortisol and not testosterone, or it\u2019ll turn into cortisol and not estrogen if stress levels are too high.\nHow to measure and track your cortisol\nQuest Diagnostics\n\nAppointment required\nClinic visit required\nVenous blood draw\n$65\nNumber of biomarkers included: 1\nSleep and activity tracking: Not Included\n1-5 business days after collection\n\nLetsgetchecked\n\nAt-home kit\nHuberman on Biohacking your Cortisol 5\nFingerprick sample self-collection (one-size fits all lancets)\n$99 one-time, $69 subscription\nNumber of biomarkers included: 1\nSleep and activity tracking: Not Included\n2-5 business days after collection\n\nInside Tracker\n\nAppointment required\nAt-home blood draw visit\n$348\nNumber of biomarkers included: 17 including Cortisol\nSleep and activity tracking: Included, 3 devices supported\n2-5 business days after collection\n\nSiPhox Health Kit\n\nAt-home kit delivered to your home\nFingerprick sample self-collection (low-pain, adjustable lancets)\n$295 one-time, $85 subscription\nNumber of biomarkers included: 17 including Cortisol\nSleep and activity tracking: Included, 200 devices supported\n2-5 business days after collection\n\nBiohacking your cortisol with Huberman\nIf you measure your cortisol and find that its out of range, don\u2019t worry! There are plenty of hacks to try for regulating and normalizing your cortisol levels.\nMorning Sunlight\nOne of the major tools Dr. Huberman recommends is getting sunlight in the morning to regulate cortisol levels. As he puts it, the best way to stimulate that increase in cortisol at the appropriate time is that very soon after waking within 30 minutes or so after waking, get outside view some sunlight, even if it\u2019s overcast, get outside view some sunlight, no sunglasses.\nAvoiding blue light at night?\nAnd I should also say avoiding bright lights from artificial sources in the evening, generally 10 PM to 4 AM, but certainly in the evening trying to dim lights in your immediate environment, trying to avoid bright screens, bright artificial lights as much as possible and accessing that deep sleep.\nEating carbs\nHuberman notes that you can use carbs (judiciously) to blunt cortisol levels.\nMany people do that reflexively, however, they reach for carbohydrate-rich foods to blunt their cortisol, because that\u2019s indeed what it does. It blunts cortisol when you ingest high carbohydrate foods, in particular starchy foods.\nIn summary, Dr. Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, highlights the crucial role that cortisol plays in regulating the body\u2019s energy levels, focus, immune system function, and inflammation regulation. He explains that cortisol is not inherently good or bad but rather its regulation is critical. Disruptions to the natural cortisol pattern can negatively impact overall health and wellbeing. Therefore, Dr. Huberman suggests various strategies to maintain a balanced circadian rhythm and cortisol pattern, including maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule, getting exposure to natural sunlight during the day, reducing stress, and avoiding exposure to blue light from electronic devices in the evening. Measuring and tracking cortisol levels can also help optimize health and wellbeing.\n&nbsp;\nDisclaimer: If you have any medical questions or concerns, please talk to your healthcare provider.

Cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, dementia and osteoporosis are common chronic diseases worldwide that contribute greatly to illness and death in the population. Each of these debilitating diseases is influenced by Vitamin D levels, and low levels of Vitamin D are a risk factor for developing all of these common and chronic diseases. Moreover, common acute respiratory infections are influenced by Vitamin D levels, and may be prevented by Vitamin D supplementation to adequate levels. Thus, anyone who is interested in improving their general health and avoiding common diseases should monitor their blood levels of Vitamin D.\nPregnant women should pay particular interest to Vitamin D blood levels, since pregnancy health and the health of the newborn are affected by Vitamin D.\nOthers that are particularly at risk for low Vitamin D levels and should be tested include individuals who:\n\nare over age 65\nare obese\njust had bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery)\nhave limited exposure to the sun\nwear long clothing outdoors\nhave dark skin\nhave osteoporosis or thin bones\nare taking medicines that may lower Vitamin D levels (see list of drugs under \u201cPrescription Medicines\u201d below)\nhave problems with intestinal absorption of vitamins because of an underlying condition such as colitis or celiac disease.\n\nWhen is the best time to measure Vitamin D levels?\nYou can measure your Vitamin D levels at any time you wish, since the blood levels of Vitamin D tend to be stable over the course of any 24-hour period.\nHow can I better understand my Vitamin D level results?\n\nOptimal: 30 to 100 ng\/dL.\nSuboptimal: 21 to 29 ng\/dL.\nDeficient: Equal to or less than 20 ng\/dL.\nToo high: Greater than 100 ng\/dL.\n\nDeficient levels of Vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (a hormone that regulates bone and calcium metabolism), a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause bone disease, and it can also cause calcium to build up in tissues and organs such as the heart and blood vessels.\nHow can I raise my Vitamin D levels?\nDietary and other lifestyle modifications\n\nExposure to daily sunlight for a sufficient length of time (30 minutes per day) is important during the winter time to maintain Vitamin D3 levels, especially for individuals with darker skin tone. Although sunscreen blocks most of the UVB rays that are required for Vitamin D production, it is recommended to wear sunscreen when outdoors for long periods of time (greater than 30 minutes) to prevent skin cancer. Extended outdoor exposure to the sun with sunscreen may allow enough UVB penetration for sufficient production of Vitamin D [3].\nVitamin D3 can also be obtained from dietary consumption of various types of fatty fish, including salmon, sardines, tuna, herring, or mackerel, chicken breast, egg yolks, beef liver or fish liver, or food that is artificially supplemented with Vitamin D3, such as milk, almond or soy milk, tofu, cereal, or orange juice.\nVitamin D2 can be obtained from the diet by consumption of certain plant fluids, such as mushrooms.\n\nSupplement additions\n\nVitamin D3 supplementation is an easy and efficient method to restore Vitamin D levels to healthy levels.\nThe recommended amount of Vitamin D3 supplementation depends on the age, health status, and medical history of the person taking the supplement:\n\nFor infants and toddlers less than 1 year of age, the recommended dose is 2000 International Units (IU) of Vitamin D3 per day for six weeks until target blood levels are reached, followed by 400 to 1000 IU per day once blood levels are in range.\nFor children between 1 and 18 years of age, the recommended dose is 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 per day for six weeks until target blood levels are reached, followed by 600 to 1000 IU per day for maintenance.\nFor adults, the recommended dose is 6000 IU of Vitamin D3 per day for eight weeks until target blood levels are reached, followed by 1500 to 2000 IU per day once blood levels are in range.\nFor obese individuals, people with malabsorption diseases, and people taking certain medications, the recommended dose is 6,000 to 10,000 IU\/day, until target blood levels are reached, followed by a maintenance dose of 3,000 to 6,000 IU\/day to maintain blood levels in the desired range.\nVitamin D supplementation may interact with other medications, and individuals taking these other medications should talk to their doctor before taking any Vitamin D supplement: aluminum-containing phosphate binders for kidney disease, atorvastatin (Lipitor) for elevated cholesterol, calcipotriene (Dovonex, Sorilux) for psoriasis, cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates, or digoxin (Lanoxin) for heart disease.\n\n\nCommon natural supplements that many people take may decrease Vitamin D levels as a side effect, including St. John\u2019s wort and kava kava. Individuals taking these supplements may require higher levels of Vitamin D supplementation.\n\nExercise\n\nA recent report that analyzes many other studies concludes that for older adults, combining Vitamin D supplementation with resistance exercise training leads to an additive improvement in musculoskeletal strength, suggesting that exercise and sufficient Vitamin D blood levels are both important for physical strength [4].\n\nSmoking\n\nSmoking has been associated with lower Vitamin D levels, and expectant mothers who smoke have an increased risk of Vitamin D lowering during low-sun exposure months in northern regions [5], suggesting a link between smoking, low Vitamin D levels, and poor maternal health.\nPassive smoking is also associated with lower Vitamin D level in children [6], suggesting that those who spend time with smokers should carefully monitor their Vitamin D levels.\n\nAlcohol\n\nThere is little evidence that alcohol intake levels substantially affect Vitamin D levels [7], suggesting that modifying alcohol intake will not dramatically alter Vitamin D levels in the long term.\n\nPrescription Medicines\nDrugs that lower Vitamin D levels include:\n\nAnti-seizure medications, including phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine.\nCertain blood pressure medicines, such as nifedipine and spironolactone.\nCancer treatments and chemotherapies, such as taxol.\nEstrogen-blocking drugs for breast cancer, including tamoxifen and fulvestrant.\nDrugs for various infections, such as rifampin or isoniazid for tuberculosis, ritonavir for HIV, and clotrimazole for fungal infections.\nVarious steroidal medications, including prednisone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone.\nDrugs that interfere with intestinal absorption of vitamins, including Orlistat (Xenical, Alli) or stimulant laxatives.\n\nIndividuals taking any of the above medications may require higher Vitamin D3 supplement doses to restore blood levels to an optimal value.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nDr. Andrew Huberman\u2019s interview with Dr. Rhonda Patrick covers relevant topics around Vitamin D\nA good commentary on Vitamin D topics from a Harvard physician\n\n**Read the National Health Service (UK) Vitamin D Review**\n\nHealth and medical importance of Vitamin D levels\nVitamin D is important to help the body absorb phosphorus and calcium into the bloodstream, and these elements are essential for bone growth. Thus, Vitamin D is important for bone metabolism, and low Vitamin D levels can lead to bone diseases including osteoporosis [8]. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to be weak or brittle, and can lead to bone fractures, falls and injury. Osteoporosis is very common in most countries, particularly among post menopausal women, with a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 5 [9]. Patients with osteoporosis frequently have mildly lower levels of Vitamin D.\nRecent evidence suggests that Vitamin D is important for many other body functions, and that Vitamin D has substantial effects on many different organs in the body. For example, individuals with low circulating levels of Vitamin D are more prone to suffer from acute respiratory infections. Furthermore, it has been shown from many studies that increasing blood levels of Vitamin D to suitable levels can diminish the risk for these acute respiratory infections [10]. Moreover, low Vitamin D blood levels are associated with worsening of asthma, and supplementation with Vitamin D to restore suitable blood levels prevents these complications of asthma as well [11].\nIn addition, low Vitamin D blood levels have been associated with other serious diseases, including multiple types of cancer such as colon, breast, and prostate cancer [12]. Supplementation with Vitamin D to achieve sufficient blood levels has been shown to decrease the overall death from cancer, according to a recent analysis, although Vitamin D supplementation does not decrease the incidence (occurrence) of cancer [13]. Importantly, low levels of Vitamin D have been associated with the development of cognitive impairment (brain decline) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [14], and there is recent evidence that supplementation with Vitamin D may prevent cognitive decline in healthy Black adults [15].\nLow Vitamin D levels are also correlated with the development of Type II, or adult onset diabetes [16]. Whether supplementation of Vitamin D can reverse Type II diabetes is controversial, but there is evidence that supplementation with high levels of Vitamin D for short periods of time can be used to effectively treat some aspects of this disease for some groups of patients [17].\nMoreover, low levels of Vitamin D are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, including Chron\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, and supplementation with Vitamin D has been show to reduce the incidence of these d[18]\u00a0In addition, a recent review concludes that supplementation with Vitamin D to achieve desired blood levels is associated with reduction of symptoms of several other diseases, including relief from major depression, pain from fibromyalgia (a disorder characterized by widespread body pain and fatigue), and the symptoms of atopic dermatitis (a condition characterized by itchy, dry, and inflamed skin) [19].\nPregnant women who are deficient in Vitamin D have an increased risk for medical complications during their pregnancy, including preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy) and the need for cesarean section [20]. In addition, the children born from mothers with low Vitamin D levels may suffer from asthma or dental cavities.\nHowever, blood levels of Vitamin D that are too high can cause health problems as well, including too much calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and kidney damage. These changes can lead to nausea, vomiting, and muscle weakness [21]. Thus, it is important to regularly monitor one\u2019s Vitamin D blood levels to make sure that they are neither too high nor too low.\nWhat forms of Vitamin D should be measured for health monitoring?\nThere are several different forms of Vitamin D in the human body, including Vitamin D3 and Vitamin D2 [22]. Almost all (about 90%) of Vitamin D3 in the body is obtained from sunlight ultraviolet B (UVB) rays on the skin, which converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (a normal molecule in the skin) to Vitamin D3 [23]. A small amount (about 10%) of Vitamin D3 in the body is obtained from dietary consumption of fish or eggs, or food that is artificially supplemented with Vitamin D3, or supplements that contain Vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 is a different form of Vitamin D that can obtained from the diet by consumption of certain plant fluids, such as mushrooms, or supplements than contain Vitamin D2.\nOnce Vitamin D3 or D2 is in the bloodstream, the liver converts Vitamin D3 or D2 to a different form of the vitamin, called 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or D2 (we will refer to either of these Vitamin D forms here as \u201c25OH Vitamin D\u201d). 25OH Vitamin D lasts for a long time in the blood stream, with a half-life of two to three weeks, meaning that after two to three weeks, the amount of 25OH Vitamin D in the blood is one-half of the original value, assuming no new sources for accumulation. For this reason, 25OH Vitamin D is the best measure of total storage levels of Vitamin D in the body. Thus, 25OH Vitamin D is the preferred form of Vitamin D for doctors and medical scientists to measure for human health and disease, since blood levels of 25OH Vitamin D correlate best with the health-related effects of this vitamin. Hence, the 25OH Vitamin D blood level is measured by SiPhox as a marker for Vitamin D status.\n25OH Vitamin D is further converted by the kidney and other tissues to a different form of Vitamin D, called 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D, which is the biologically active form of Vitamin D. However, since 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D is rapidly converted to other forms of the Vitamin (i.e. rapidly metabolized), 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D does not accurately reflect body storage levels of Vitamin D. Therefore, blood levels of 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D do not correlate well with the health-related effects of this vitamin, and SiPhox does not measure 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D.\nTracking your Vitamin D with SiPhox Health:\n\nAt-home kit delivered to your home\nFingerprick sample self-collection (low-pain, adjustable lancets)\n$295 one-time or subscribe to get $85 per test*\nNumber of biomarkers included: 17 (4 inflammation markers including Vitamin D)\nSleep and activity tracking: Included, 200 devices supported\n2-5 business days after collection\n\n\n    \n        \n            Start your siphox health journey\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Home health testing has never been this good\n        \n    \n    Subscribe to SiPhox and start tracking your Vitamin D + 16 other critical biomarkers as well as sleep, activity and heart data all in one comprehensive dashboard.\n\n    Get started\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nDisclaimer: If you have any medical questions or concerns, please talk to your healthcare provider.
