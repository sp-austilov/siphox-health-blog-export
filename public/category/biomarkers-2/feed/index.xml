<p>To get the most accurate insights from your SiPhox blood test—whether you’re using <strong>EasyDraw</strong> or <strong>finger prick</strong>—timing and preparation matter. Here&#8217;s how to prepare based on the panel you’re taking:</p>
<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Best Time to Test</strong></h2>
<p>Test <strong>in the morning</strong>, ideally <strong>within 1–2 hours of waking up</strong>. This aligns with your body’s natural hormone rhythms (like <strong>cortisol</strong> and <strong>testosterone</strong>) and reduces variability.</p>
<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f9d8-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🧘‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Should You Fast?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, <strong>fast for 8–12 hours</strong> before your test. Water is fine. Fasting improves accuracy for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glucose &amp; insulin</strong> (Core, Heart &amp; Metabolic)</li>
<li><strong>Lipids</strong> like LDL and triglycerides</li>
<li><strong>Hormones</strong> like cortisol, DHEA-S, IGF-1, and even testosterone</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid supplements for 24 hours <strong>before testing, </strong>especially <strong>biotin, B12, vitamin D</strong>, and <strong>adaptogens</strong>, which may skew results. Take prescribed medications as instructed by your health provider.</p>
<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f3cb.png" alt="🏋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Exercise</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Avoid intense workouts the morning of your test</strong>. Exercise can elevate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cortisol</strong></li>
<li><strong>Testosterone</strong></li>
<li><strong>Glucose and insulin</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creatine kinase (CK)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Light walking is fine, but no strenuous activity.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Iron Saturation?</strong></h2>
<p>Iron saturation is a blood test marker that measures the percentage of transferrin, the main protein that transports iron in the blood, that is currently carrying iron. It reflects how effectively your body is distributing available iron for essential functions</p>
<h2><strong>Why is Iron Saturation Important?</strong></h2>
<p>Iron saturation helps identify both iron deficiency and iron overload. It is critical for oxygen delivery through the formation of hemoglobin in red blood cells, energy production at the cellular level, and immune function.</p>
<p>Abnormal levels can indicate potential health issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/iron-deficiency-anemia"><strong>Low iron saturation (below 20%)</strong></a> may signal iron deficiency or anemia. Common symptoms include tiredness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and poor concentration.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443"><strong>High iron saturation (above 50%)</strong></a> may indicate iron overload, which over time can contribute to conditions such as hemochromatosis, liver injury, joint pain, or heart dysfunction.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How can I better understand my iron saturation levels?</strong></h2>
<p>Iron saturation is calculated using serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). This marker helps assess how efficiently iron is being distributed throughout the body. Here are the general ranges for iron saturation:</p>
<h3><strong>Lab Range:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Out of range (low): &lt;20%</li>
<li>In range: 20%–50%</li>
<li>Out of range (high): &gt;50%</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>SiPhox Ranges:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Out of range (low): &lt;15%</li>
<li>In range: 15%–55%</li>
<li>Out of range (high): &gt;55%</li>
</ul>
<p>Iron saturation is typically interpreted alongside other iron-related markers such as <a href="https://siphoxhealth.com/hub/biomarkers-2/iron">serum iron</a>, <a href="https://siphoxhealth.com/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-ferritin">ferritin</a>, and UIBC. While serum iron can fluctuate daily, iron saturation gives a more balanced view of iron availability and transport.</p>
<p>Understanding your iron saturation in context can help determine whether you are experiencing iron deficiency or iron overload, both of which may require lifestyle changes or medical treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>How can I maintain optimal iron saturation levels?</strong></h2>
<p>Maintaining balanced iron saturation involves managing both iron intake and absorption based on your current levels.</p>
<p><strong>If your iron saturation is low:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eat iron-rich foods</strong> such as red meat, poultry, lentils, beans, tofu, and leafy greens.</li>
<li><strong>Pair iron with vitamin C</strong> (from citrus, peppers, or tomatoes) to improve absorption.</li>
<li><strong>Cook with cast iron cookware</strong> to naturally boost the iron content of your meals. This is especially effective when preparing acidic or liquid-based dishes.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid drinking tea, coffee, or calcium-rich beverages</strong> with meals, as they can block iron absorption.</li>
<li><strong>Consider iron supplements</strong> if recommended by your healthcare provider, especially if dietary changes are not sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If your iron saturation is high:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit intake of red meat and iron-fortified foods</strong> to avoid excess iron.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid unnecessary iron supplements</strong> unless specifically prescribed.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce vitamin C supplementation</strong>, as it enhances iron absorption from food.</li>
<li><strong>Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet</strong> to support proper iron metabolism and transport.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring">continuous glucose monitor (CGM)</a> is a wearable sensor that tracks your glucose levels throughout the day and night, providing real-time data on how your body responds to food, activity, stress, and sleep. Unlike traditional fingerstick tests, CGMs measure glucose in interstitial fluid every few minutes, allowing for early detection of spikes, crashes, and trends that blood tests alone might miss. This data empowers users to make informed lifestyle changes to support stable blood sugar and long-term metabolic health.</p>
<h2>Why is glucose important?</h2>
<p>Glucose is the primary energy source for the body’s cells and is tightly regulated to maintain optimal function. Stable glucose levels are crucial for brain function, muscle activity, hormonal balance, and metabolic health. Chronically elevated or unstable glucose levels are associated with increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>What is % of Glucose Readings Above the Range?</h2>
<p>The % of Glucose Readings Above the Range reflects the proportion of time your blood glucose levels exceed the target range during continuous glucose monitoring. This metric is a key indicator of how often your body experiences hyperglycemia, or elevated blood sugar, over a given period.</p>
<h2>How can I better understand my % of glucose readings above the range?</h2>
<p>Even if your fasting glucose appears normal, a high percentage of readings above range may signal underlying metabolic stress or early-stage dysregulation. Here are the <a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis">general ranges</a> for fasting % of glucose readings above the range:</p>
<h3>Lab Range:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Out of range (low): &lt;0 %</li>
<li>In range: &lt;0.5 %</li>
<li>Out of range (high): &gt;0.5 %</li>
</ul>
<h3>SiPhox Ranges:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Optimal Range: &lt;0.1 %</li>
<li>Good Range: 0.1-0.5 %</li>
</ul>
<p>Values above this range may indicate frequent episodes of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), which can increase the risk of complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction over time. Common symptoms of <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/7104-diabetes">high glucose levels</a> include increased thirst and urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow healing of cuts and wounds, and frequent infections.</p>
<p>Values below this range suggest that <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/42/8/1593/36184/Clinical-Targets-for-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring">elevated glucose excursions are infrequent</a> or well-managed. This is generally favorable but should be considered in the context of other markers.</p>
<h2>What is Average Glucose Level?</h2>
<p>Average glucose level represents the mean of all glucose readings collected over a 2 week period. It gives a broader picture of daily glycemic exposure than individual measurements. This value is closely tied to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and is a key indicator of long-term glucose control.</p>
<h2>How can I better understand my average glucose levels?</h2>
<p>Average glucose reflects the mean blood sugar level over a given period. Unlike a single fasting or post-meal reading, average glucose captures fluctuations throughout the day, including during meals, sleep, and periods of stress or physical activity. Here are the <a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis">general ranges</a> for average glucose level:</p>
<h3><strong>Lab Range:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Out of range (low): &lt;70 mg/dL</li>
<li>In range: 70-110 mg/dL</li>
<li>Out of range (high): &gt;110 mg/dL</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>SiPhox Ranges:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Optimal Range: 80-100 mg/dL</li>
<li>Good Range: 70-80 mg/dL or 100-110 mg/dL</li>
</ul>
<p>Values above this range may indicate chronic hyperglycemia and a higher risk of insulin resistance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. Common symptoms of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685">high average glucose</a> include increased thirst and urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow healing of cuts and wounds, and frequent infections.</p>
<p>Values below this range may suggest hypoglycemia or overtreatment with glucose-lowering medications. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685">Symptoms of low average glucose</a> include hunger, weakness, blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and in severe cases, confusion or loss of consciousness.</p>
<h2>What is Estimated Fasting Glucose level?</h2>
<p>Fasting glucose, also known as fasting blood sugar, is a critical marker of metabolic health and refers to the concentration of glucose in the blood after an overnight fast. SiPhox estimates your fasting glucose by taking an average of a sample of the lowest readings throughout a 24 hour period. It provides insight into the body’s ability to maintain and regulate blood sugar levels within a narrow range, even in the absence of food intake.</p>
<h2><strong>How can I better understand my fasting glucose levels?</strong></h2>
<p>Fasting glucose is typically measured after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Here are the <a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis">general ranges</a> for fasting glucose levels:</p>
<h3><strong>Lab Range:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Out of range (low): &lt;70 mg/dL</li>
<li>In range: 70-125 mg/dL</li>
<li>Out of range (high): &gt;125 mg/dL</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>SiPhox Ranges:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Optimal Range: 70-99 mg/dL</li>
<li>Good Range: 99-125 mg/dL</li>
</ul>
<p>Values above this range may indicate hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), while values below the range may suggest hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/7104-diabetes">Symptoms of high fasting glucose levels</a> include increased thirst and frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow healing of cuts and wounds, and frequent infections. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685">Symptoms of low fasting glucose</a> include hunger, weakness, blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, confusion/disorientation, dizziness/lightheadedness, and nausea.</p>
<h2>What is Glucose Variability?</h2>
<p>Glucose variability describes how much your glucose levels fluctuate throughout the day. High glucose variability, especially frequent or large swings between highs and lows, has been linked to increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and blood vessel damage. These effects may raise the risk of complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, and eye disease, even when average glucose appears normal.. Studies show that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16567820/">reducing glucose variability</a> can independently improve outcomes, especially in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>CGMs provide tools like <a href="https://diatribe.org/diabetes-management/understanding-average-glucose-standard-deviation-cv-and-blood-sugar-variability"><strong>standard deviation (SD)</strong> and <strong>coefficient of variation (CV)</strong></a> to help quantify variability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard deviation (SD)</strong> measures how far readings deviate from your average.</li>
<li><strong>Coefficient of variation (CV)</strong> expresses SD as a percentage of average glucose—values under 36% are generally considered acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lower glucose variability is a sign of metabolic stability and better resilience to lifestyle factors like stress, sleep loss, or high-carb meals.</p>
<h2>How can I better understand my glucose variability?</h2>
<p>Glucose variability measures how much your blood sugar levels fluctuate throughout the day. Here are the <a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis">general ranges</a> for glucose variability:</p>
<h3><strong>Lab Range:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Out of range (low): &lt;0 %</li>
<li>In range: &lt;33 %</li>
<li>Out of range (high): &gt;33 %</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>SiPhox Ranges:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Optimal Range: &lt;25 %</li>
<li>Good Range: 25-33 %</li>
</ul>
<p>Values above this range indicate high glycemic variability, which has been linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes complications. Symptoms may include energy crashes, brain fog, irritability, and cravings after meals due to rapid glucose swings.</p>
<p>Values below this range suggest more stable glucose levels, which is generally favorable. However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685">extremely low variability</a> combined with low average glucose may indicate unrecognized hypoglycemia or overcorrection with medications.</p>
<h2>How can I improve my glucose levels?</h2>
<p><strong>Use your CGM to identify patterns.</strong> <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring">Continuous glucose monitors</a> offer powerful real-time insights. Tracking how meals, exercise, stress, and sleep affect your glucose allows you to fine-tune your habits and improve control.</p>
<p><strong>Eat to minimize glucose spikes.</strong> A diet rich in fiber, lean protein, and healthy fats helps keep glucose stable. Avoid refined carbs and sugars, which tend to cause sharp elevations. Combining carbs with protein or fat can also <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/7104-diabetes">slow glucose absorption</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise regularly, especially after meals.</strong> Physical activity, especially walking or light movement after eating, enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces glucose spikes. Consistent exercise helps your muscles use glucose more efficiently, supporting long-term stability.</p>
<p><strong>Improve sleep and manage stress.</strong> Poor sleep and high stress elevate cortisol, which can raise blood glucose levels. Prioritizing 7–9 hours of quality sleep and practicing stress-reducing techniques like meditation or deep breathing can improve glucose control.</p>
<p><strong>Take your medications as prescribed.</strong> If you have diabetes, following your physician’s treatment plan is essential. This includes taking oral medications or insulin as directed, checking your glucose regularly, and attending follow-up visits. Medication adherence plays a critical role in preventing complications and keeping your glucose levels within a healthy range.</p>

<h3 data-start="0" data-end="22">What is Calcium?</h3>
<p data-start="23" data-end="400">Calcium is a vital mineral that plays a key role in bone strength, muscle function, nerve signaling, and blood clotting. Most of the body&#8217;s calcium is stored in bones and teeth, while a small but crucial amount circulates in the blood to support various physiological processes. Measuring blood calcium levels helps assess bone health, kidney function, and metabolic balance.</p>
<h3 data-start="402" data-end="433">Why is Calcium Important?</h3>
<p data-start="434" data-end="995">Calcium levels in the blood must remain tightly regulated for the body to function properly. Low calcium (hypocalcemia) may indicate vitamin D deficiency, kidney disease, or issues with parathyroid function, leading to muscle cramps, tingling, and weakened bones. High calcium (hypercalcemia) can result from conditions like hyperparathyroidism, excessive vitamin D intake, or certain cancers, potentially causing fatigue, kidney stones, and abnormal heart rhythms. Regular calcium testing can help identify imbalances early and prevent complications.</p>
<h3 data-start="997" data-end="1045">How Can I Maintain Optimal Calcium Levels?</h3>
<p data-start="1046" data-end="1149">Maintaining balanced calcium levels requires proper nutrition, hormone regulation, and kidney health.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) is a measure of kidney function that estimates how well blood is filtered by the kidneys, helping to diagnose and monitor kidney disease.]]></description>
			

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>What is eGFR?</h3>
<p>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is a test used to assess how well your kidneys are functioning. It estimates the amount of blood that gets filtered by the glomeruli (tiny filters in the kidneys) each minute. The following image depicts the complexity of the kidney, starting with the nephron.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/glomerular-disease?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=sharing+button&amp;utm_content=%2Fhealth-information%2Fkidney-disease%2Fglomerular-disease" data-sanitized-target="_blank"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0656/6798/9733/files/Screenshot_2024-03-12_133721_480x480.png?v=1710265095" alt="" width="406" height="372" /></a></p>
<p><em>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases &#8211; Glomerular Disease</em></p>
<p>The nephron is the basic <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/kidneys-how-they-work#:~:text=Each%20of%20your%20kidneys%20is,your%20blood%20and%20removes%20wastes." data-sanitized-target="_blank">structural and functional unit of the kidney</a></span>, responsible for the vital process of filtering blood, removing waste products, and regulating water and solute balance in the body. Each human kidney contains approximately one million nephrons, which work collectively to perform the kidney&#8217;s complex functions. The structure of a nephron is specially designed to efficiently filter blood, reabsorb necessary nutrients and water, and excrete waste products in the form of urine.</p>
<p>The glomerulus plays a crucial role within the kidney as a component of the nephron. The glomerulus is a network of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) located at the beginning of the nephron. Its roles include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blood Filtration</strong>: The glomerulus is where the filtration of blood begins. Blood pressure forces water, salt, glucose, amino acids, and waste products (like urea and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://siphoxhealth.com/pages/creatinine" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sanitized-target="_blank">creatinine</a></span>) from the blood through the capillary walls and into the Bowman&#8217;s capsule, another part of the nephron that collects the filtrate. The filtrate then travels through the rest of the nephron, where further processing occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention of Protein Loss</strong>: The structure of the glomerulus prevents large molecules, such as proteins and blood cells, from being filtered into the urine, retaining them within the bloodstream.</li>
</ol>
<p>The eGFR is calculated based on your blood <a href="https://siphoxhealth.com/pages/creatinine" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sanitized-target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">creatinine</span></a> level, age, body size, and gender. This calculation provides a critical insight into the kidney&#8217;s health, indicating how efficiently they&#8217;re filtering waste from your blood.</p>
<p>Unlike direct measurements of kidney function, which can be invasive and complex, eGFR offers a simple and non-invasive way to monitor kidney health. It&#8217;s a crucial part of any comprehensive health assessment, particularly for those with risk factors for kidney disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, or a family history of kidney failure.</p>
<h3>Why is eGFR Important?</h3>
<p>The primary importance of eGFR lies in its role in detecting and monitoring kidney disease. According to the <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/sixstepshealthprimer" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/sixstepshealthprimer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Kidney Foundation</span></a>, 33% (1 in 3 people) of American adults are at risk for kidney disease. Healthy kidneys ensure the removal of toxins and waste materials from the blood, maintaining a delicate balance of body fluids and electrolytes. A decline in eGFR can indicate a reduction in kidney function, signaling acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to CKD, impaired kidneys can cause heart disease, heart attack and stroke, high blood pressure, weak bones, nerve damage, and low red blood cell count.</p>
<p>Monitoring eGFR levels is essential for diagnosing conditions that affect kidney function, assessing the severity of kidney damage, and guiding the management and treatment of kidney-related disorders. It&#8217;s particularly important for individuals with conditions that can impair kidney function, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.</p>
<h3>How can I better understand my eGFR results?</h3>
<p>eGFR results are typically reported in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m² (mL/min/1.73 m²). When interpreting eGFR results, this table from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.kidney.org/sites/default/files/11-10-1813_estimated_glomerular_filtration_rate.pdf" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.kidney.org/sites/default/files/11-10-1813_estimated_glomerular_filtration_rate.pdf">National Kidney Foundation</a></span> illustrates how even normal kidney function could accompany kidney damage:</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://ukkidney.org/health-professionals/information-resources/uk-eckd-guide/about-egfr" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://ukkidney.org/health-professionals/information-resources/uk-eckd-guide/about-egfr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UK Kidney Association</span></a>:</p>
<div data-dynamic-ranges="true" data-test="1"></div>
<div data-ranges="true">
<ul>
<li>Healthy: ~60-120 mL/min/1.73 m²</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimal: ≥100 mL/min/1.73 m²</li>
<li>Good: 90-99.9 mL/min/1.73 m²</li>
<li>Fair: 80.1-89.9 mL/min/1.73 m²</li>
<li>Pay attention: ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m²</li>
<li>Alert: &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m²</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that eGFR is an estimate of kidney function and must be interpreted within the context of other clinical findings and patient factors. For example, a mildly decreased eGFR in an elderly individual without any other signs of kidney disease may be considered normal aging. Conversely, even a slight decrease in eGFR in a young adult may warrant further investigation. <a href="https://www.kidneyfund.org/all-about-kidneys/tests/blood-test-egfr#what-does-my-egfr-mean" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.kidneyfund.org/all-about-kidneys/tests/blood-test-egfr#what-does-my-egfr-mean"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">American Kidney Fund</span></a> recommends discussing your eGFR results with your doctor, and doing so immediately if your levels are 60 or less is very important.</p>
<h3>How can I maintain optimal eGFR levels?</h3>
<p>While improving renal function is not easy, it is possible. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3862566/" data-sanitized-target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">study from 2013</span></a> found that it is possible to improve renal function at any stage of CKD!</p>
<p>In addition to staying healthy and reducing blood pressure and blood sugar through weight management, regular exercise, following a balanced diet, and practicing healthy habits (quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake), the <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/sixstepshealthprimer" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/sixstepshealthprimer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Kidney Foundation</span></a> also recommends that people with kidney disease should:</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Changes:</strong> Reducing salt intake can help improve kidney function. <a href="https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/salthealth/salt-and-the-kidneys/#:~:text=A%20high salt diet will,can lead to kidney disease." data-sanitized-target="_blank" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/salthealth/salt-and-the-kidneys/#:~:text=A%20high salt diet will,can lead to kidney disease."><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Action on Salt</span></a> states that a high salt diet can disrupt the balance of sodium and limit kidney function, promoting high blood pressure and straining the kidneys. Moderate protein consumption, according to this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962279/" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962279/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">study from 2018</span></a>, can reduce potential glomeruli damage caused by high protein intake. A low-protein diet can preserve renal function in those who have CKD.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle</strong> <strong>Changes: </strong>According to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(20)30724-1/fulltext" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(20)30724-1/fulltext">American Journal of Kidney Diseases</a></span>, NSAIDs can harm kidney function by reducing blood flow and prostaglandin (maintains GFR and renal blood flow) production, impairing sodium and water excretion, leading to acute kidney injury. So refrain from using NSAIDs. Additionally, getting an annual flu shot can help since the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/publications-resources/ckd-and-flu.html" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/publications-resources/ckd-and-flu.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CDC</span></a> emphasizes the importance of the flu vaccine for people with CKD who are “at high risk of developing serious flu complications”. Additionally, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1586-5#citeas" data-sanitized-target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exercise therapy</span></a> and certain <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230954/" data-sanitized-target="_blank">dietary patterns</a></span> may be associated with a lower rate of eGFR decline.</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">What is Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb)?</h3>
<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb) is an immune system protein that mistakenly targets thyroglobulin, a key protein involved in thyroid hormone production. The presence of TgAb in the blood is often associated with autoimmune thyroid conditions, where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to inflammation and potential dysfunction. Measuring TgAb helps assess thyroid health and can be particularly useful in diagnosing and monitoring autoimmune thyroid diseases.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">Why is TgAb Important?</h3>
<p>Elevated TgAb levels are commonly linked to <strong class="sc-jwpOCX gKUUgZ" data-mark="strong">Hashimoto’s thyroiditis</strong> and <strong class="sc-jwpOCX gKUUgZ" data-mark="strong">Graves’ disease</strong>, two autoimmune disorders that can lead to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Since thyroid disorders often develop gradually, testing for TgAb can help detect autoimmune activity early, even before symptoms appear.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">How Can I Maintain Optimal Thyroid Health?</h3>
<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">Managing TgAb levels involves addressing underlying thyroid conditions and supporting overall immune function. Monitoring your thyroid function with regular testing and managing any known autoimmune conditions you may have will help to maintain optimal thyroid health.</p>

Inadequate progesterone levels in the United States can cause menstrual irregularities, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. According to the Cleveland Clinic, maintaining balanced progesterone levels is crucial for reproductive health and overall well-being.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">How can I better understand my progesterone levels?</h3>
<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">Progesterone levels in females are typically measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. Normal progesterone levels vary depending on the menstrual cycle phase, pregnancy status, and individual health factors.</p>
<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.abim.org/Media/bfijryql/laboratory-reference-ranges.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sanitized-target="_blank">American Board of Internal Medicine</a></span> defines normal progesterone levels as:</p>

<p>While testosterone levels are typically much lower in females compared to males, they still play a vital role in various <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526128/" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526128/" data-sanitized-target="_blank">physiological processes</a></span>. Fluctuations or abnormalities in female testosterone levels can impact reproductive health, sexual function, mood, and overall health. Testosterone is essential for maintaining optimal health and well-being in females. Proper testosterone levels contribute to reproductive health, libido, muscle strength, bone density, mood regulation, and overall vitality.</p>
<h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-sanitized-data-token-index="0" data-token-index="0" data-sanitized-data-reactroot="" data-reactroot="">How can I better understand my testosterone levels?</span></h3>
<p><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-sanitized-data-token-index="0" data-token-index="0" data-sanitized-data-reactroot="" data-reactroot="">Free and total testosterone are two different measurements. Total testosterone quantifies, as the name suggests, the overall quantity of testosterone including molecules that are both free (unbound) and bound to proteins (mainly <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://siphoxhealth.com/pages/shbg" data-sanitized-target="_blank">SHBG</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://siphoxhealth.com/pages/albumin" data-sanitized-target="_blank">albumin</a></span>). On the other hand, a measure of free testosterone does not measure molecules that are bound to proteins. This is an important measurement as free testosterone is generally more bioactive than bound testosterone. People who may be experiencing symptoms of low testosterone but have normal levels of total testosterone may be advised to take a free testosterone test.</span></p>

<h3 class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light" data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">Why is HOMA-IR important?</h3>
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light" data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">HOMA-IR is crucial for maintaining and assessing metabolic health because it offers a quantifiable measure of insulin resistance, a pivotal factor in numerous metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. By detecting insulin resistance early, HOMA-IR helps clinicians identify at-risk individuals before the manifestation of clinical symptoms, allowing for timely interventions. Additionally, HOMA-IR is valuable for monitoring the progression or remission of metabolic diseases in patients, providing insights into how effectively they are responding to treatment strategies like diet modifications, exercise, or pharmacological interventions. It also aids in tailoring these therapeutic strategies by highlighting the severity of insulin resistance, which can guide the aggressiveness of treatment approaches. Moreover, a high HOMA-IR score can indicate an increased risk of developing diabetes, enabling preventive measures to be put in place. Since <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" data-sanitized-target="_blank" data-sanitized-data-mce-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/">insulin resistance</a></span> is often linked with other conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity, HOMA-IR also serves as a comprehensive tool for evaluating an individual&#8217;s overall metabolic health and pinpointing multiple risk factors simultaneously.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment="1">How can I better understand my HOMA-IR levels?</h3>
<p>In general, a low HOMA-IR value is sought after because it is indicative of low fasting insulin and fasting glucose. While there is no consensus on &#8220;normal&#8221; HOMA-IR values yet, here are the generally accepted ranges:</p>
<div data-dynamic-ranges="true" data-test="1"></div>
<div data-ranges="true">
<ul>
<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://thinkvida.com/blog/are-you-insulin-sensitive/">&lt;1.0</a></span> is considered insulin sensitive (low diabetes risk)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o2h9nxkOv8" data-sanitized-target="_blank">1.5-2.9 may be indicative of insulin resistance</a></span> (borderline diabetes risk)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://thinkvida.com/blog/are-you-insulin-sensitive/" data-sanitized-target="_blank">2.9</a>&lt;</span> is considered significantly insulin resistant (high diabetes risk).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranges specific to the Cardiometabolic Program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimal: ≤1</li>
<li>Good: 1.1-1.49</li>
<li>Fair: 1.5-1.99</li>
<li>Pay attention: ≥2</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It is important to discuss your results with a physician if you are concerned with your HOMA-IR value to assess your metabolic health.</p>
<h3>How can I maintain optimal HOMA-IR levels?</h3>
<p>Since HOMA-IR is a calculation of fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels, some ways to improve these markers include:</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Changes: </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/21/4524" data-sanitized-target="_blank">Mediterranean diets</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8707429/" data-sanitized-target="_blank">high-protein diets</a></span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3092/309231672007.pdf" data-sanitized-target="_blank">low-calorie diets</a></span> are among a few interventions that have been shown to reduce HOMA-IR in various studies.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle Changes: </strong>Whether it is HIIT, moderate-intensity, strength training, or resistance training, studies show that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000143">physical activity can significantly reduce</a></span> HOMA-IR compared to sedentary individuals. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079222000077#bib49">Sufficient sleep duration</a></span> (about 8 hours) lowers HOMA-IR levels.</p>

<h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-sanitized-data-token-index="0" data-token-index="0" data-sanitized-data-reactroot="" data-reactroot="">What is prolactin (PRL)?</span></h3>
<p>Prolactin is a hormone synthesized mostly by the pituitary gland in the brain. In women, it is primarily known for regulating milk production after childbirth (lactation) and playing a role in the menstrual cycle. It also affects male reproductive health by regulating testosterone production, impacting libido, erectile function, and fertility. In both men and women, prolactin is released in response to stress, sleep, and other factors, and can have interactions with cortisol and thyroid hormones. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2954_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2954_13_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2954_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2954_13_1');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2954_13_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2954_13_1" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-sanitized-data-token-index="0" data-token-index="0" data-sanitized-data-reactroot="" data-reactroot="">Why is prolactin important?</span></h3>
<p>PRL is critical for the analysis of a variety of issues, and abnormal levels may indicate pituitary gland irregularities, including tumors. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://home.siphoxhealth.com/pricing/unlimited?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_term=siphox%20health&amp;utm_content=&amp;tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=687640324952&amp;tw_campaign=19925277251&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb-zBhCmARIsAAfUI2uY8He_1BAaSvECNZqCwMQtT6Y41yJBFoDVgu-iAMehWiJa-uL2CFIaAjjgEALw_wcB">SiPhox Health</a></span> includes PRL in our Hormone+ Panel to help monitor and manage PRL levels.</p>
<p>In men, low PRL is correlated with negative metabolic, psychological, and sexual characteristics. On the other hand, high PRL can inhibit testosterone production, causing decreased energy, muscle mass, and blood count (anemia). High PRL can also lead to erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and low sperm production</p>
<p>In women, low PRL can impede sufficient breast milk production. While high PRL can cause menstrual cycle and ovulation irregularities. High PRL levels can cause vaginal dryness and a milky discharge from the nipples when not pregnant (galactorrhea). Additionally, females of reproductive age with either abnormally low and abnormally high PRL may be more prone to cardiovascular and metabolic complications.</p>
<h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-sanitized-data-token-index="0" data-token-index="0" data-sanitized-data-reactroot="" data-reactroot="">How can I better understand my Prolactin levels?</span></h3>
<p>According to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/prolactin-blood-test#:~:text=The%20normal%20values%20for%20prolactin,80%20to%20400%20%C2%B5g%2FL)">Mount Sinai</a></span>, normal PRL values are:</p>
<div data-dynamic-ranges="true" data-test="1"></div>
<div data-ranges="true">
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Men</span>: &lt;20 ng/mL</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nonpregnant women</span>: &lt;25 ng/mL</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pregnant women</span>: 80-400 ng/mL</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In both men and women, certain medications (antipsychotic, cardiovascular, opiates, etc.), health conditions (infections, autoimmune disease, Sheehan syndrome, etc.), and pituitary gland disorders (prolactinomas or pituitary gland tumors) can all cause abnormally high or low levels of prolactin, which is why it is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned about any of your results. It is important to remember that prolactin levels follow a circadian rhythm associated with the onset of sleep and can appear higher or lower depending on a multitude of factors, with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6304861/" data-sanitized-target="_blank">optimal timing</a></span> for blood tests being 2-3 hours after waking and while fasting. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2954_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2954_13_2');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2954_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2954_13_2');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2954_13_2" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[2]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2954_13_2" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></span></p>
<h3>How can I maintain optimal Prolactin levels?</h3>
<p>If your PRL levels are abnormal, consider the following strategies:</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Changes:</strong> Consuming a diet rich in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9316450/">vitamin C</a></span> (dopamine inhibitor) can help to lower prolactin levels since dopamine suppresses prolactin. Limiting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15085559/">gluten</a></span> consumption can also help to decrease prolactin production since gluten stimulates prolactin release.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle Changes: </strong>Limiting alcohol consumption can help to decrease prolactin levels and increase testosterone levels. Reducing stressors can also aid in mitigating higher <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6304861/">prolactin</a></span> levels.</p>
<p><strong>Supplementation:</strong> Consuming <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.conceiveabilities.com/about/blog/high-prolactin-and-infertility#:~:text=Foods%20that%20lower%20prolactin%20levels,help%20boost%20those%20vitamin%20levels.">vitamin B6</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10064178/">vitamin E</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.conceiveabilities.com/about/blog/high-prolactin-and-infertility#:~:text=Foods%20that%20lower%20prolactin%20levels,help%20boost%20those%20vitamin%20levels.">zinc</a></span>, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9701317/">ashwagandha</a></span> supplements could aid in lowering elevated prolactin levels. Including these nutrients in your diet can also help to decrease prolactin levels. If your PRL levels are slightly low, many women try <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7388198/#CD011505-bbs2-0200" data-sanitized-target="_blank">pharmacologic or natural galactagogues</a></span> (milk boosters) such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7602737/#B26-genes-11-01208" data-sanitized-target="_blank">fenugreek</a></span> to raise PRL levels and promote lactation.</p>
