							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rising cost of health care has hit Americans differently depending on their economic status. There is no shortage of news stories covering the reality of those with higher incomes having higher life expectancies than those in lower financial brackets. Healthcare services such as clinical diagnostic testing may be out of reach for those who could really use it. So what are some of the things a company can do to make clinical diagnostic testing more accessible for everyone? How can an important medical test be affordable to all?</p>
<p>On this episode of Health &amp; Life Sciences at the Edge, host Michelle Dawn Mooney talks with Intel Head of Business Innovation and Life Science Specialist Blake Harlan and SiPhox Chief Product Officer Mike Dubrovsky about clinical diagnostic testing, the way it is used, and the way its use can be improved.</p>
<p>‚ÄúClinical diagnostic testing is actually a major part of the [healthcare] system,‚Äù says Dubrovsky. ‚ÄúSeventy percent of all medical decisions require diagnostic tests. However, the way that it‚Äôs done now is very reactive, so the whole system is based on first the patient having symptoms and then they‚Äôre put through a series of tests to try to resolve the problem.‚Äù Harlan and Dubrovsky further mention how it‚Äôs easy for those in higher income brackets to get tested more often, as those types of tests cost much more than the ones for reactive patients who are presently experiencing symptoms.</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Biosensing offers people real-time insight into their health status. Regular insight, rather than one-time results at an annual checkup, helps people assess how lifestyle factors are impacting their health, whether they need to make adjustments, and which adjustments might have the most impact. Michael Dubrovsky and Josh Clemente discuss the value of biosensing and how it has the potential to disrupt the healthcare industry, shifting from a diagnose-and-treat approach to a preventive and actionable approach.</p>
