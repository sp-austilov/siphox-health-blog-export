</div><h3>1. Insulin Resistance: Is your low-carb diet improving your metabolic health?</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons people turn to a low-carb diet is to improve insulin sensitivity and stabilize blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance, a condition where the body&#8217;s cells become less responsive to insulin, is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Monitoring specific biomarkers can help determine whether your low-carb diet is effectively improving your metabolic health.</p>
<h3>1.1 HbA1c, Fasting Insulin, and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-hemoglobin-a1c/"><strong>HbA1c</strong></a></span> is a long-term marker of blood sugar control, reflecting average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. A decrease in HbA1c levels indicates improved blood sugar management, which is a positive sign that your low-carb diet is working.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-fasting-insulin/"><strong>Fasting insulin</strong></a></span> levels provide insight into your insulin sensitivity. Lower fasting insulin levels typically suggest that your body requires less insulin to manage blood glucose levels, a key indicator of improved insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>In addition to these traditional markers, <strong>Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)</strong> is becoming an increasingly popular tool for those on low-carb diets. CGM devices provide real-time data on your blood glucose levels throughout the day, allowing you to see how specific foods, meals, and activities affect your blood sugar. This can be especially useful in identifying hidden carbohydrates or other dietary factors that might be keeping your blood sugar levels higher than expected.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t use a CGM continuously, incorporating it once or twice a year can be a valuable way to check on your glucose response in real time to specific foods and meals. This periodic monitoring can help ensure that your low-carb diet is achieving the desired effect and allow you to make any necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Tracking these biomarkers together—HbA1c, fasting insulin, and CGM data—gives a comprehensive view of how well your low-carb diet is managing your blood sugar and insulin levels. If you&#8217;re not seeing improvements in your HbA1c or fasting insulin levels, or if your CGM data shows unexpected spikes in blood sugar, it may be worth closely examining your food choices to ensure you&#8217;re truly adhering to a low-carb regimen.</p>
<h3>1.2 Triglyceride/HDL-C Ratio</h3>
<p>The <a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-triglyceridehdl-ratio/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Triglyceride/HDL-C ratio</strong></span></a> is another important marker of metabolic health. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood, while HDL-C is the &#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol that helps remove excess cholesterol from your bloodstream. A lower Trig/HDL-C ratio is associated with better insulin sensitivity and a lower risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>For many people on a low-carb diet, this ratio improves significantly as triglyceride levels decrease and HDL-C levels increase.<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_1');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3620_1_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3620_1_1" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> Ideally, this ratio should fall below 1.0, indicating that your diet is positively impacting your metabolic health. However, if hidden carbs are sneaking into your meals, this ratio might not improve as expected. A persistent high Trig/HDL-C ratio could be a sign that your carbohydrate intake is higher than you realize, and adjustments may be necessary to achieve the desired metabolic benefits.</p>
<h3>2. Hormonal Health: Is your low-carb diet affecting your hormones?</h3>
<p>Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions, including metabolism, stress response, and reproductive health. While a low-carb diet can offer several health benefits, it&#8217;s essential to monitor how it might be impacting your hormone levels. Certain hormonal imbalances can arise, particularly if the diet is not well-balanced or if you&#8217;re not paying attention to how your body responds to the changes in macronutrient intake.</p>
<h3>2.1 Cortisol</h3>
<p><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-cortisol/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cortisol</strong></span></a> is a hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stress. While short-term increases in cortisol are normal, chronic elevation can lead to several health issues, including weight gain, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and immune system suppression. A low-carb diet can be a stressor on the body, particularly in the initial stages as your body adjusts to burning fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_2');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_2');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3620_1_2" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[2]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3620_1_2" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<p>Elevated cortisol levels could indicate that your diet is causing undue stress, which may necessitate adjustments. This might include increasing carbohydrate intake slightly, focusing on nutrient-dense foods, or incorporating stress-reducing practices like mindfulness or yoga into your routine. Monitoring cortisol levels can help you ensure that your low-carb diet is not negatively impacting your stress response, especially if you&#8217;re experiencing difficulty sleeping, which can be a sign of cortisol dysregulation.</p>
<h3>2.2 Sex Hormones (Testosterone and Estrogen)</h3>
<p><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-testosterone/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Testosterone</strong></span></a> (for males) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-estradiol-e2/"><strong>estrogen</strong></a></span> (for females) are critical sex hormones that play a significant role in mood, energy levels, and overall well-being. Low levels of these hormones can lead to issues such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, and reduced libido.</p>
<p>A low-carb diet can sometimes impact sex hormone levels, particularly if the diet is too restrictive or if there is inadequate intake of essential fats and nutrients<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_3');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_3');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3620_1_3" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[3]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3620_1_3" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span>. For men, maintaining healthy testosterone levels is important, as low levels can affect muscle mass, energy, and mood. For women, estrogen balance is crucial for menstrual health, bone density, and mood regulation.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing symptoms of hormonal imbalance, it may be necessary to reassess your diet. Ensuring you&#8217;re getting enough healthy fats, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, and considering a more moderate low-carb approach can help maintain healthy hormone levels.</p>
<h3>2.3 Thyroid Function</h3>
<p>The thyroid gland produces <a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-free-t3/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>T3</strong></span></a> (triiodothyronine) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-free-t4/"><strong>T4</strong></a></span> (thyroxine), hormones that regulate metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-thyroid-stimulating-hormone-tsh/"><strong>Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)</strong></a></span>, produced by the pituitary gland, regulates the production of T3 and T4. These hormones are vital for overall energy balance and metabolic function.</p>
<p>While a low-carb diet typically doesn’t cause thyroid issues in people with normal thyroid function, there’s a possibility that eating too few carbohydrates can lower T3 and T4 levels, particularly in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/hypothyroidism-and-keto-diet">individuals with pre-existing thyroid conditions</a></span>. Low thyroid hormone levels can lead to symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and constipation.</p>
<p>If you have a history of thyroid issues or start experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism, it’s important to monitor your thyroid markers (T3, T4, and TSH) while on a low-carb diet. You may need to adjust your carbohydrate intake or work with a healthcare provider to manage your thyroid health effectively.</p>
<h3>3. Kidney and Liver Health: Are your organs coping with low-carb?</h3>
<p>While a low-carb diet can have various health benefits, it’s important to ensure that your kidneys and liver are not being adversely affected. These organs play crucial roles in detoxification, metabolism, and overall homeostasis. Monitoring specific biomarkers can help you keep track of your kidney and liver health to ensure your diet is not putting undue stress on these vital organs.</p>
<h3>3.1 Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-creatinine/"><strong>Creatinine</strong> </a></span>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-bun/"><strong>Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)</strong></a></span> are markers commonly used to assess kidney function. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism, and the kidneys are responsible for filtering it out of the blood. Elevated creatinine levels can indicate impaired kidney function. BUN measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea, another waste product processed by the kidneys. Elevated BUN levels can also suggest kidney stress or dysfunction.</p>
<p>A low-carb diet, especially one that’s high in protein, can sometimes lead to elevated BUN and creatinine levels. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_4');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_4');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3620_1_4" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[4]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3620_1_4" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> This doesn’t necessarily mean your kidneys are in trouble, but it’s a sign to monitor closely. If these markers are consistently high, you may need to adjust your protein intake or ensure you’re staying properly hydrated to support kidney function.</p>
<h3>3.2 ALT and AST</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-alt/"><strong>ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)</strong></a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-ast/"><strong>AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)</strong></a></span> are enzymes found in the liver that help process proteins and other substances. Elevated levels of these enzymes can indicate liver stress or damage. Since the liver plays a key role in metabolizing fats, a high-fat, low-carb diet could potentially put extra strain on the liver.</p>
<p>Monitoring ALT and AST levels while on a low-carb diet can help you ensure that your liver is handling the dietary changes well. If you notice elevated levels of these enzymes, it might be worth re-evaluating your fat intake or considering a more balanced approach to your diet. Additionally, incorporating liver-friendly foods like leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, and healthy fats (like omega-3 fatty acids) can help support liver function.</p>
<h3>4. Nutritional Deficiencies: Is your low-carb diet giving you all the nutrients you need?</h3>
<p>While a low-carb diet can offer various benefits, it’s important to ensure that you’re still getting all the essential nutrients your body needs. Restricting certain food groups can sometimes lead to deficiencies in key vitamins and minerals, which can have significant health implications. Monitoring specific nutrient levels can help you ensure that your diet remains balanced and nutritionally adequate.</p>
<h3>4.1 Vitamin B12</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-b12/"><strong>Vitamin B12</strong></a></span> is essential for nerve function, DNA production, and the formation of red blood cells. It’s primarily found in animal products, which are typically a staple in low-carb diets. However, if you’re following a low-carb diet that’s also low in animal products—such as a vegetarian or vegan version—you may be at risk for B12 deficiency. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_5');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_5');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3620_1_5" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[5]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3620_1_5" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<p>Symptoms of B12 deficiency can include fatigue, weakness, and neurological issues like numbness or tingling in the hands and feet. If you’re not consuming enough B12-rich foods, consider incorporating more meat, fish, eggs, and dairy into your diet, or discuss supplementation with your healthcare provider.</p>
<h3>4.2 Vitamin D</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-vitamin-d/"><strong>Vitamin D</strong></a></span> is crucial for bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. It helps your body absorb calcium and plays a role in muscle function. While your body can produce vitamin D through sun exposure, it’s also found in certain foods like fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products.</p>
<p>On a low-carb diet, particularly if you’re avoiding fortified foods, you may be at risk for <a href="https://www.health.com/weight-loss/keto-supplements"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">vitamin D deficiency</span></a>, especially if you live in a region with limited sunlight. A deficiency in vitamin D can lead to weakened bones, increased susceptibility to infections, and other health issues. Consider getting your vitamin D levels checked, and if necessary, incorporating supplements or vitamin D-rich foods into your diet.</p>
<h3>4.3 Iron and Ferritin</h3>
<p><strong>Iron</strong> is essential for producing hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-ferritin/"><strong>Ferritin</strong> </a></span>is a protein that stores iron and releases it as needed. On a low-carb diet, especially one that’s low in red meat, you may be at risk for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.health.com/weight-loss/keto-supplements">iron deficiency</a></span>, which can lead to anemia and symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and pale skin.</p>
<p>Women, in particular, are at higher risk for iron deficiency due to menstruation. Monitoring your ferritin levels can give you insight into your iron status. If levels are low, consider increasing your intake of iron-rich foods like red meat, spinach, and legumes, or talk to your healthcare provider about supplementation.</p>
<h3>5. Lipid Levels: Is your ApoB out of control?</h3>
<p>One of the most debated aspects of a low-carb, high-fat diet is its impact on lipid levels, particularly concerning heart health. While traditional markers like LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) are often monitored, emerging research suggests that <strong>ApoB</strong> (apolipoprotein B) might be a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk. Understanding and tracking these lipid markers can help you determine whether your low-carb diet is supporting or potentially harming your heart health.</p>
<h3>5.1 ApoB and LDL-C</h3>
<p><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-apob/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ApoB</strong> </span></a>is a protein that is found in all particles that carry <a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-ldl-c/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LDL-C</span></a>, as well as other potentially atherogenic particles like VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) and IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein). Because each of these particles can contribute to plaque buildup in arteries, ApoB is considered a more precise marker for assessing cardiovascular risk compared to LDL-C alone.</p>
<p>While a low-carb diet typically leads to an increase in LDL-C for many people <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_6');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_6');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3620_1_6" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[6]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3620_1_6" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span>, it’s important to monitor ApoB levels to get a clearer picture of your heart health. Elevated ApoB levels suggest a higher number of atherogenic particles, which could increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. If your ApoB levels are rising, it may be necessary to adjust your diet, perhaps by incorporating more monounsaturated fats (like olive oil and avocados) and reducing saturated fat intake.</p>
<h3>5.2 Decrease in Triglycerides</h3>
<p>One of the key benefits often associated with a low-carb diet is a significant reduction in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-triglycerides/"><strong>triglyceride</strong></a></span> levels. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood, and high levels are considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/low-carbohydrate-diets/">reduction in triglycerides</a></span> is usually due to the diet&#8217;s low carbohydrate content, which decreases the liver&#8217;s production of triglycerides.</p>
<p>Lowering triglycerides is generally seen as a positive outcome, as it indicates improved metabolic health. However, if you’re not seeing a reduction in triglycerides on a low-carb diet, it could be a sign that hidden carbs are sneaking into your meals, or that your fat intake might need adjustment. Tracking triglyceride levels can help ensure that your diet is truly supporting your cardiovascular health.</p>
<h3>6. Inflammation: Is your low-carb diet reducing or increasing inflammation?</h3>
<p>Inflammation is a double-edged sword; while acute inflammation is a natural response to injury or infection, chronic inflammation is associated with numerous health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and autoimmune conditions. One of the potential benefits of a low-carb diet is its ability to reduce systemic inflammation, but this isn’t always the case for everyone. Monitoring specific markers can help you determine whether your diet is helping or hindering in this regard.</p>
<h3>6.1 High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP)</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/hub/biomarkers-2/biomarker-high-sensitivity-c-reactive-protein-hs-crp/"><strong>High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP)</strong></a></span> is a marker commonly used to measure systemic inflammation. Elevated levels of hsCRP are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other inflammatory conditions. A low-carb diet may reduce hsCRP levels for some individuals, especially if it leads to weight loss and improved metabolic health <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_7');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_3620_1('footnote_plugin_reference_3620_1_7');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3620_1_7" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[7]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3620_1_7" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span>.</p>
<p>However, if your low-carb diet is high in processed meats, trans fats, or other inflammatory foods, you might see an increase in hsCRP levels. This could indicate that rather than reducing inflammation, your diet is exacerbating it. Tracking your hsCRP levels regularly can provide valuable insights into how your diet is affecting your inflammatory status.</p>
<p>If your hsCRP levels are elevated, consider evaluating your food choices. Emphasizing anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish (rich in omega-3s), leafy greens, nuts, and seeds, while reducing intake of processed meats and refined oils, can help mitigate inflammation. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress management can further support the anti-inflammatory effects of your diet.</p>
