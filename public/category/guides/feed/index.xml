							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve received your blood work results. Now what?</p>
<p>Those pages of numbers and medical terminology can feel overwhelming—but they&#8217;re actually a treasure map to better health. The question is: how do you turn raw data into meaningful change?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Siphox&#8217;s personalized health coaching comes in. For just $39, you get a dedicated 30-minute consultation with an expert health coach who will decode your biomarkers and create a customized action plan designed specifically for you.</p>
<h2>What You Get: More Than Just a Conversation</h2>
<p>Your health coaching session includes two powerful components:</p>
<p><strong>1. A 30-Minute Live Consultation</strong> Talk directly with a qualified health coach who will review your biomarkers, understand your lifestyle and goals, and answer your questions in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>2. A Written Action Plan</strong> After your call, you&#8217;ll receive a detailed written summary including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview of what was discussed</li>
<li>Analysis of your key biomarkers and what they mean</li>
<li>Specific, prioritized action items tailored to your results</li>
<li>Clear next steps to implement immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&#8217;t generic advice—it&#8217;s a personalized roadmap created just for you.</p>
<h2>What Happens During Your 30-Minute Call</h2>
<p><strong>Before the Call</strong> Your coach reviews your biomarker results and prepares to discuss the most important findings for your specific situation.</p>
<p><strong>During the Call (30 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction and Goals</strong> (5 min): Share your health objectives, current lifestyle, and any concerns</li>
<li><strong>Biomarker Review</strong> (10-15 min): Your coach explains your key results in plain English, highlighting what&#8217;s optimal, what needs attention, and why</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle Discussion</strong> (5-10 min): Review your current diet, exercise, sleep, stress levels, and supplements</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A and Recommendations</strong> (5-10 min): Ask questions and receive initial guidance on next steps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After the Call</strong> Following the call, you&#8217;ll receive your written action plan documenting everything discussed, with clear action items ranked by priority.</p>
<h2>Why This Works: The Science of Personalized Coaching</h2>
<p><strong>Context-Aware Analysis</strong> A slightly elevated marker might be insignificant for one person but concerning for another. Your coach considers your complete picture—age, lifestyle, goals, and health history—not just reference ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritized Interventions</strong> When multiple biomarkers need attention, where do you start? Your coach helps you focus on the changes that will have the biggest impact first, creating momentum rather than overwhelm.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Action Steps</strong> Generic advice fails because it doesn&#8217;t fit your real life. Your action plan accounts for your schedule, preferences, and constraints—making it something you&#8217;ll actually follow.</p>
<p><strong>Written Documentation</strong> Having your action plan in writing means you can refer back to it anytime, share it with your doctor, and track your progress over time.</p>
<h2>Common Areas Your Coach Will Address</h2>
<p>Depending on your biomarkers and goals, your coaching session may cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metabolic Health</strong>: Blood sugar regulation, insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles</li>
<li><strong>Hormonal Balance</strong>: Thyroid function, sex hormones, stress hormones</li>
<li><strong>Cardiovascular Health</strong>: Cholesterol management, blood pressure, inflammatory markers</li>
<li><strong>Nutrition Strategy</strong>: Dietary patterns, macronutrient balance, meal timing</li>
<li><strong>Exercise Programming</strong>: Cardio vs. strength training, exercise intensity and frequency</li>
<li><strong>Sleep Optimization</strong>: Sleep duration, quality, and circadian rhythm</li>
<li><strong>Stress Management</strong>: Cortisol regulation, recovery strategies</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Supplementation</strong>: Which supplements to take, dosing, and timing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is Health Coaching Right for You?</h2>
<p>This service is perfect if you:</p>
<p>✓ Have bloodwork results but feel unsure how to improve them</p>
<p>✓ Want expert guidance without committing to ongoing coaching</p>

<h2>Longevity/Longevity+</h2>
<h3>What These Panels Cover</h3>
<p>The SiPhox <strong>Longevity</strong> and <strong>Longevity+</strong> panels give you a comprehensive look into your long-term health. They measure biomarkers tied to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heart health</strong> – lipids, inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular risk factors</li>
<li><strong>Metabolic health</strong> – glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and key hormones</li>
<li><strong>Nutritional status</strong> – vitamins and minerals that support energy and cellular repair</li>
<li><strong>Inflammation and aging</strong> – markers that influence longevity and disease risk</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Longevity+ differs:</strong> The core <strong>Longevity</strong> panel covers foundational markers for cardiovascular, metabolic, nutritional, and inflammatory health. <strong>Longevity+</strong> builds on that by adding <strong>60+ extra biomarkers</strong> spanning <strong>advanced lipids and cardiovascular risk, broader metabolic and endocrine hormones, longevity and cellular-aging cues, and a dedicated toxicology suite (including heavy metals and other environmental exposures).</strong> In short, Longevity+ turns a strong baseline view into a deep, systems-level assessment that can uncover hidden drivers of risk and rate-limiters for performance and healthy aging.</p>

<h2>Allergy</h2>
<h3>What the Panel Measures</h3>
<p>The SiPhox <strong>Allergy Panel</strong> measures <strong>IgE antibodies</strong> to <strong>food and environmental allergens</strong> and reports <strong>Total IgE</strong> to help contextualize overall allergy load. Results for each allergen are grouped into clear categories (negative/uncertain, low, moderate, high, very high) so you can see where sensitization may be clinically meaningful.</p>
<p>Coverage can include <strong>up to 295 allergens across 165 sources</strong>, spanning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foods:</strong> dairy, eggs, nuts, seafood, fruits, vegetables, grains, spices</li>
<li><strong>Environmental triggers:</strong> pollen (trees, grasses, weeds), dust mites, molds, pets</li>
<li><strong>Other exposures:</strong> insect venom, latex, and known cross-reactive proteins</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Testing Process</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> – Order your Allergy Panel through SiPhox Health.</li>
<li><strong>At-home sample</strong> using the <strong>EasyDraw arm collector</strong> for a simple, comfortable blood collection.</li>
<li><strong>Processing</strong> – The lab analyzes your IgE antibody responses across the allergen panel.</li>
<li><strong>Results Timeline</strong> – Reports are typically available within <strong>5–7 business days</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What You Receive</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Per-allergen IgE values</strong> with category bands (negative/uncertain → very high)</li>
<li><strong>Total IgE</strong> to gauge overall sensitization</li>
<li><strong>Grouped summaries</strong> to spot patterns across allergen families</li>
<li><strong>Notes on cross-reactivity</strong> to inform next steps and conversations with your clinician</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Understanding your IgE profile helps identify likely triggers, supports personalized diet and lifestyle adjustments, and provides evidence to discuss with your allergist or healthcare provider. It is a powerful first step in managing allergic conditions and improving daily comfort.</p>

What is CO2? CO2 (carbon dioxide) is a blood biomarker that measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood, primarily in the form of bicarbonate. It helps assess your body&#8217;s acid-base balance and can indicate respiratory, metabolic, or kidney issues. Understanding CO2 as a Blood Biomarker CO2, or carbon dioxide, is a waste product&#8230; <a class="more-link" href="/hub/guides/biomarkers/carbon-dioxide/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Carbon Dioxide</span></a>]]></description>
			

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>What is CO2?</h2>
<p>CO2 (carbon dioxide) is a blood biomarker that measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood, primarily in the form of bicarbonate. It helps assess your body&#8217;s acid-base balance and can indicate respiratory, metabolic, or kidney issues.</p>
<h2>Understanding CO2 as a Blood Biomarker</h2>
<p>CO2, or carbon dioxide, is a waste product produced by your cells during normal metabolism. When measured as a blood biomarker, CO2 primarily exists in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3-), which plays a crucial role in maintaining your body&#8217;s pH balance. This measurement is typically included in basic metabolic panels and comprehensive metabolic panels, providing valuable insights into your respiratory function, kidney health, and overall metabolic status.</p>
<p>The CO2 blood test doesn&#8217;t actually measure carbon dioxide gas directly. Instead, it measures the total amount of carbon dioxide that exists in various forms in your blood, with about 90% being bicarbonate, 5% dissolved CO2, and 5% carbonic acid. This measurement helps healthcare providers understand how well your lungs and kidneys are working together to maintain proper acid-base balance.</p>
<h2>Why CO2 Levels Matter for Your Health</h2>
<p>Your body maintains a delicate balance between acids and bases, and CO2 plays a central role in this equilibrium. When you breathe, your lungs remove excess CO2 from your blood. Meanwhile, your kidneys regulate bicarbonate levels to help neutralize acids in your body. This intricate system keeps your blood pH within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, which is essential for proper cellular function.</p>
<p>Abnormal CO2 levels can indicate various health conditions. High levels might suggest respiratory problems where your lungs aren&#8217;t effectively removing CO2, metabolic alkalosis, or certain kidney conditions. Low levels could indicate metabolic acidosis, kidney disease, or conditions causing hyperventilation. Understanding your CO2 levels helps identify these issues early, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.</p>
<h2>Normal CO2 Ranges and What They Mean</h2>
<p>The normal range for CO2 in blood typically falls between:</p>
<div data-dynamic-ranges="true" data-test="1"></div>
<div data-ranges="true">
23–29 mEq/L (milliequivalents per liter) for adults
</div>
<p>These ranges may vary slightly between laboratories and can be influenced by factors such as altitude, age, and certain medications. It&#8217;s important to interpret your results in context with other blood tests and your overall health picture.</p>
<h2>High CO2 Levels (Hypercapnia)</h2>
<p>CO2 levels above 29 mEq/L may indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
<li>Metabolic alkalosis from prolonged vomiting or excessive antacid use</li>
<li>Cushing&#8217;s syndrome</li>
<li>Conn&#8217;s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism)</li>
<li>Severe dehydration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Low CO2 Levels (Hypocapnia)</h2>
<p>CO2 levels below 23 mEq/L may suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metabolic acidosis from diabetes, kidney disease, or severe diarrhea</li>
<li>Respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation or anxiety</li>
<li>Addison&#8217;s disease</li>
<li>Ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning</li>
<li>Salicylate (aspirin) overdose</li>
</ul>
<h2>Factors That Influence CO2 Levels</h2>
<p>Several lifestyle and environmental factors can affect your CO2 levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Temporarily increases CO2 production as your muscles work harder and produce more metabolic waste; respiratory rate increases to maintain balance.</li>
<li><strong>High altitude:</strong> Can lead to slightly lower CO2 levels as your body adapts to lower oxygen by breathing more rapidly.</li>
<li><strong>Medications:</strong> Diuretics and corticosteroids can raise CO2 levels by causing metabolic alkalosis, while medications like metformin can lower CO2 if they cause lactic acidosis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optimizing Your CO2 Levels</h2>
<p>Maintaining healthy CO2 levels involves supporting respiratory and kidney function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage in regular cardiovascular exercise to strengthen respiratory function.</li>
<li>Stay well-hydrated to support kidney health and acid-base regulation.</li>
<li>Address underlying respiratory issues with breathing exercises, pulmonary rehabilitation, or appropriate medications.</li>
<li>Manage metabolic causes by treating root conditions such as kidney disease or diabetes, and following appropriate dietary plans.</li>
<li>Maintain a balanced diet that avoids excessive protein or antacid overuse to prevent acid-base imbalances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular monitoring of your CO2 levels, especially if you have conditions affecting your lungs or kidneys, helps track your health status and treatment effectiveness. Understanding your CO2 levels as part of your complete metabolic panel provides valuable insights into your overall health.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY OF YOUR RESULTS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN.</strong></p>

<p>To get the most accurate insights from your SiPhox blood test—whether you’re using <strong>EasyDraw</strong> or <strong>finger prick</strong>—timing and preparation matter. Here&#8217;s how to prepare based on the panel you’re taking:</p>
<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Best Time to Test</strong></h2>
<p>Test <strong>in the morning</strong>, ideally <strong>within 1–2 hours of waking up</strong>. This aligns with your body’s natural hormone rhythms (like <strong>cortisol</strong> and <strong>testosterone</strong>) and reduces variability.</p>
<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/72x72/1f9d8-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🧘‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Should You Fast?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, <strong>fast for 8–12 hours</strong> before your test. Water is fine. Fasting improves accuracy for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glucose &amp; insulin</strong> (Core, Heart &amp; Metabolic)</li>
<li><strong>Lipids</strong> like LDL and triglycerides</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Day 3 hormone testing is a common practice in reproductive health, providing a standardized baseline to evaluate your hormonal balance and fertility.]]></description>
			

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When your doctor asks you to schedule bloodwork on the third day of your menstrual cycle, there&#8217;s a reason behind the specificity. Day 3 hormone testing has become the gold standard in reproductive health—not by accident, but because it captures your hormones at their most revealing moment.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" /><b data-stringify-type="bold">Why Day 3 matters</b><br aria-hidden="true" />Day 3 represents a unique window in your cycle: the early follicular phase, when both estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest and most stable levels. Think of it as your hormonal baseline—before the cascade of ovulation begins to shift everything.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" />During this window, we can see the conversation happening between your brain and your ovaries. Your pituitary gland releases FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) to signal your ovaries, which respond by producing estradiol, AMH, and SHBG. Testing at Day 3 captures this signal-and-response system in its clearest form, giving us insight into your reproductive hormone balance before the cycle&#8217;s next phase kicks in.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" />Because the early follicular phase is relatively consistent across most cycles, Day 3 results can be reliably compared to established reference ranges—making it easier to spot patterns or potential concerns.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" /><b data-stringify-type="bold">A note on timing:</b> If your cycle runs slightly shorter or longer than average, testing on Day 2 or Day 4 works just as well. What matters most is catching that stable, early-follicular window.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" /><b data-stringify-type="bold">What if you&#8217;re on birth control—or don&#8217;t have regular periods?</b><br aria-hidden="true" />Here&#8217;s where things get more nuanced. If you&#8217;re using hormonal contraception, your body isn&#8217;t going through natural ovulatory cycles. Hormonal birth control suppresses ovulation and keeps hormone levels relatively stable, which means a &#8220;Day 3&#8221; doesn&#8217;t technically exist in the traditional sense.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" /><b data-stringify-type="bold">If you&#8217;re on hormonal birth control:</b> You can test at any time during the active hormone phase. While you might experience regular withdrawal bleeds, these are artificial—triggered by the drop in synthetic hormones, not by natural ovulation. Since your hormone levels remain suppressed throughout, there&#8217;s no meaningful difference between testing on &#8220;Day 3&#8221; of a withdrawal bleed versus any other day. What matters is understanding that your results will reflect the influence of synthetic hormones rather than your natural baseline.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" /><b data-stringify-type="bold">If your cycles are irregular or absent:</b> Whether due to perimenopause, PCOS, postpartum recovery, stress, or other factors, you can test at any time. The key is working with a provider or testing service that offers condition-specific reference ranges designed to account for different hormonal patterns, ensuring your results remain meaningful and actionable even without a defined cycle day.</p>
<p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Planning to stop birth control?</b><br aria-hidden="true" />If you&#8217;re coming off hormonal contraception and want to understand your natural fertility baseline, timing matters. Hormone levels don&#8217;t bounce back overnight—they may take anywhere from several weeks to several months to return to their natural rhythm, depending on the type of contraception you used.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" />Three months is a common guideline for waiting before testing, but individual recovery varies. For the most reliable snapshot of your natural hormones, it&#8217;s best to wait until your cycles have resumed and stabilized.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" /><b data-stringify-type="bold">The bottom line</b><br aria-hidden="true" />Day 3 hormone testing offers valuable insight into reproductive health and fertility—especially if you have natural menstrual cycles. But it&#8217;s not the only window that matters.<br aria-hidden="true" />If you&#8217;re on hormonal contraception, in perimenopause, or managing irregular cycles, you can still gain meaningful information by testing at other times. The key is understanding what your results represent within your body&#8217;s current context—whether that&#8217;s a natural cycle, hormone therapy, or a transitional phase.</p>
<p><br aria-hidden="true" />Hormone testing can be informative at any stage of life. What matters most is knowing how to interpret your results based on where you are right now.</p>

<p>When you receive your lab results, you&#8217;ll notice two different types of grading systems: the “lab reference range” and our clinical optimization grades “SiPhox Grades”. Understanding the difference between these approaches can help you make better decisions about your health.</p>
<h2>Laboratory Reference Ranges: How They&#8217;re Determined</h2>
<p>Laboratory reference ranges are typically established through a standardized process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing a large sample of the local population</li>
<li>Including people who aren&#8217;t necessarily in optimal health</li>
<li>Using statistical analysis to include approximately 95% of results</li>
<li>Creating a bell curve of results and setting ranges based on standard deviations</li>
<li>Focusing primarily on identifying disease states rather than optimal health</li>
</ul>
<p>This means these ranges are designed to identify clearly abnormal results rather than guide you toward optimal health. They reflect what&#8217;s common in the general population, not what&#8217;s ideal for your wellbeing.</p>
<p><a href="/hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3747" src="/hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png" alt="" width="1999" height="1387" srcset="/hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png 1999w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-300x208.png 300w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-1024x710.png 1024w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-768x533.png 768w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-1536x1066.png 1536w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-1568x1088.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></a></p>
<h2>Our SiPhox Grades: A Research-Based Approach</h2>
<p>Our grading system is fundamentally different. We determine our ranges through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive review of peer-reviewed clinical studies</li>
<li>Analysis of research linking specific biomarker levels to health outcomes</li>
<li>Evaluation of data from longevity and wellness research</li>
<li>Integration of findings from multiple populations and health contexts</li>
<li>Focus on identifying truly optimal ranges for health and performance</li>
</ul>
<p>This evidence-based approach allows us to provide more refined and meaningful grades for those looking to improve their health beyond “average”:</p>
<h3>Pay Attention (Red)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Results requiring proactive attention and intervention</li>
<li>Often still falls within standard laboratory &#8220;normal&#8221; ranges</li>
<li>Our more stringent criteria serve as early warning signals</li>
<li>Allows for preventive action before markers become out of range</li>
<li>Based on clinical evidence of potential health impacts</li>
<li>May indicate need for lifestyle changes or medical consultation</li>
<li>Represents an opportunity for early intervention</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fair (Yellow)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Results that fall short of evidence-based optimal ranges</li>
<li>Based on studies showing room for health improvement</li>
<li>May be &#8220;normal&#8221; by standard ranges but below optimal</li>
<li>Indicates opportunity for targeted optimization</li>
</ul>
<h3>Good (Blue)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Results aligned with positive health outcomes in research</li>
<li>Better than population averages</li>
<li>Supported by studies showing good health markers</li>
<li>Represents solid foundation for wellness</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimal (Green)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Results matching levels seen in research on exceptional health</li>
<li>Based on studies of longevity and peak performance</li>
<li>Aligned with best documented health outcomes</li>
<li>Represents evidence-based ideal targets</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Our Approach Makes a Difference: A Practical Example</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take Vitamin D as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard laboratory range: 25-100 ng/mL</li>
<li>Our evidence-based optimization grades:
<ul>
<li>Pay Attention: &lt; 30 ng/mL or &gt; 100 mg/mL</li>
<li>Fair: 30-35 ng/mL</li>
<li>Good: 35-40 ng/mL</li>
<li>Optimal: 40-70 ng/mL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While a result of 32 ng/mL would be &#8220;within range&#8221; on a standard report, research shows better health outcomes at higher levels. Our grades reflect this scientific evidence rather than just population averages.</p>
<h2>The Power of Evidence-Based Optimization</h2>
<p>Our approach offers several advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>More nuanced understanding of your health markers</li>
<li>Grades based on actual health outcomes rather than population statistics</li>
<li>Targets derived from scientific research rather than averages</li>
<li>Focus on optimization rather than just avoiding disease</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: Standard ranges tell you if you&#8217;re similar to the general population. Our grades tell you how close you are to optimal health based on clinical evidence. This difference empowers you to make more informed decisions about your health journey.</p>

</div><h2>What is ApoB?</h2>
<p>Lipoproteins serve as intricate transport vehicles for lipids (fat) in the body, featuring a lipid core (consisting of fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides) enveloped by proteins, phospholipids, and free cholesterol.</p>
<p>There are different types of lipoproteins each with distinct compositions and functions. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-density lipoprotein (HDL)</li>
<li>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)</li>
<li>Intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)</li>
<li>Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Their role is to navigate the circulatory and lymphatic systems. HDL, renowned as &#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol, prevents arterial plaque buildup, while elevated levels of others, particularly LDLs, pose cardiovascular risks.</p>

<p><em>“Lipoproteins: What They Are, Function &amp; Importance.” Cleveland Clinic, 22 May 2022, <a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23229-lipoprotein">my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23229-lipoprotein</a>.</em></p>
<p>Apolipoproteins (Apo), synthesized primarily in the liver, are integral components of lipoproteins, usually attached to their surface (as depicted in the image above). ApoB is generally associated with our “bad” lipoproteins such as VLDLs, IDLs, and LDL, whereas HDLs “good cholesterol” are associated with a different type of apolipoprotein, “ApoA1”.</p>
<p>Where apolipoproteins become useful is in indicating the abundance of all lipoprotein particles in the bloodstream. For example, ApoB is attached to the “bad” lipoproteins in a 1:1 ratio. They also play a key role in the movement of our lipoproteins around the circulatory system. By interacting with various enzymes and receptors involved in lipid metabolism APOB facilitates the uptake of cholesterol and other lipids by peripheral tissues.</p>
<h2>What exactly is cholesterol?</h2>
<p>Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that&#8217;s found in all the cells in your body. It is both produced by the body (primarily in the liver) and obtained from dietary sources, especially animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs. Cholesterol is an essential component for the body, necessary for cell membranes, bile production, and hormone synthesis.</p>
<p>The nomenclature surrounding lipoproteins and cholesterol can be confusing. Cholesterol is a type of lipid (fat) found in the blood and cells of the body. Lipoproteins, as explained above, are particles that transport cholesterol and other lipids through the bloodstream. HDLs (high density lipoproteins) are often called &#8220;good cholesterol&#8221; because they help remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, while LDLs are known as &#8220;bad cholesterol&#8221; because high levels can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries. Therefore, when we talk about HDL or LDL cholesterol, we&#8217;re actually referring to the cholesterol carried by the LDL lipoproteins.</p>
<p>Imbalanced cholesterol levels, especially elevated LDL cholesterol, heighten the risk of cardiovascular disease. Dietary choices, notably consumption of saturated and trans fats, are key influencers of cholesterol levels. Regular screening is advised to monitor cholesterol levels, with interventions typically encompassing lifestyle adjustments such as diet and exercise, complemented by medical treatments like statins when needed.</p>

<h2>Why is lipid transport by apolipoproteins important?</h2>
<p>Lipids, including cholesterol and triglycerides, are vital for many bodily functions. However, lipids are not soluble in blood. Without apolipoproteins, lipids would remain insoluble in the bloodstream, leading to their accumulation and potential blockages in blood vessels. By forming complexes with lipids to create lipoproteins, apolipoproteins ensure efficient transport of lipids to various tissues and organs. Proper functioning and balance of apolipoproteins and lipoproteins are essential in preventing diseases. Dysregulation can lead to lipid disorders, such as hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood), which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Problems arise when there is an imbalance between the different types of cholesterol. High levels of LDL cholesterol, often referred to as &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol, can lead to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaques in the arteries, which can restrict blood flow and lead to heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_4');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_4');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2809_13_4" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[4]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2809_13_4" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> It&#8217;s the balance between LDL and HDL, along with the overall level of cholesterol, that determines the risk of cholesterol-related health issues.</p>

<h2>Why is ApoB considered “bad”?</h2>
<p>ApoB is a primary component of LDL, the so-called &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol. High levels of LDL in the blood are a well-established risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. ApoB is not only present in LDL but also in other atherogenic particles like VLDL and IDL. These lipoproteins are involved in transporting triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood and also contribute to atherosclerosis. Importantly, ApoB-containing lipoproteins have the ability to penetrate the arterial wall, where they deposit cholesterol and initiate the formation of plaques. This process, known as atherosclerosis, is a major contributor to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Hence, monitoring ApoB levels is crucial for assessing cardiovascular risk and implementing preventive measures. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_5');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_5');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2809_13_5" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[5]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2809_13_5" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<p>Numerous studies have shown that ApoB is a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_6');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_6');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2809_13_6" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[6]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2809_13_6" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_7');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_7');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2809_13_7" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[7]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2809_13_7" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_8');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_8');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2809_13_8" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[8]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2809_13_8" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> In some cases, ApoB has been found to be a better indicator than traditional lipid measures like total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol because it reflects the total particle number rather than just the cholesterol content. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_9');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_9');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2809_13_9" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[9]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2809_13_9" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while ApoB is associated with &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol, it is a necessary component of normal lipid metabolism. The &#8220;bad&#8221; designation primarily relates to its role in the context of atherogenic lipoproteins and their contribution to cardiovascular disease risk. Managing ApoB levels, typically through diet, lifestyle changes, and sometimes medication, can be an important part of reducing cardiovascular risk.</p>
<h2>Interpretation and management of ApoB</h2>
<p>To interpret your results, here are a few values that can be used to gauge your cardiovascular health. It is important to consult with your physician if you are concerned with any of your results.</p>
<ul>

<p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, high ApoB may be a result of pregnancy, high cholesterol, or kidney issues while low ApoB may be present if you have sepsis, liver disease, malabsorption, or high estrogen levels. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_14');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2809_13('footnote_plugin_reference_2809_13_14');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2809_13_14" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[14]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2809_13_14" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> Of course, there are a variety of other factors that may be associated with abnormal ApoB levels, so it is best to consult with a physician if you are concerned with your levels to determine the root cause and seek treatment.</p>
<p>If your ApoB levels are high, it is worth consulting your physician to see how you can manage your levels as underlying diseases may be at play.

<h2>Why is tracking your ApoB important?</h2>
<p>Cardiovascular health is no joke. Several studies mentioned earlier in this guide have revealed just how vital ApoB is as a predictor for cardiovascular events. The good news is that LDL, HDL, ApoB, ApoA, and triglycerides are all modifiable. But the first step in monitoring your levels is to test your levels, and that’s where SiPhox Health comes in. The benefit of <a href="https://home.siphoxhealth.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SiPhox Health</span></a> is having the freedom to track such volatile biomarkers frequently, affordably, and conveniently from the comfort of your home. Want to see what your ApoB levels are right now? How about testing every week to see if limiting saturated fats or exercising are actually changing your levels? Or maybe you’re thinking of trying statins and want to monitor your levels to determine whether the prescribed dosage is right for you? With <a href="https://home.siphoxhealth.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SiPhox Health</span></a>, your health is in your hands.

</div><h2>What is Hemoglobin A1C?</h2>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) is a type of protein that circulates in the blood and is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_1');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_1" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></span></p>
<p>A HbA1c test is a measure of the percent of total hemoglobin that has been glycosylated, or attached to glucose (sugar). This is significant because the percentage of glycosylated HbA1c correlates to the average amount of glucose that is present in the bloodstream over the past 2 to 3 months. Since diabetes is a disease in which blood glucose levels are too high, elevated HbA1c can be indicative of pre-diabetes or diabetes. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_2');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_2');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_2" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[2]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_2" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<h2>Why is measuring HbA1c important?</h2>
<p>Many sources suggest that A1C levels between 5.7% and 6.4% are indicative of pre-diabetes, whereas higher levels are indicative of diabetes. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_3');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_3');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_3" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[3]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_3" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span>. According to the CDC, 136 million American adults have either diabetes or pre-diabetes <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_4');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_4');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_4" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[4]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_4" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span>, and out of all American adults with diabetes, 47.4% had A1C values over 7%.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">That’s where the HbA1c test really shines— in its value as a predictor and monitor of this serious metabolic disease. Unlike daily blood sugar tests, HbA1c reflects average glucose levels over two to three months, offering a more comprehensive picture of how well diabetes is being controlled.</span></p>
<p>This helps in making informed decisions about treatment adjustments and lifestyle changes. High HbA1c levels indicate poor blood sugar control, increasing the risk of diabetes-related complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage (nephropathy), eye damage (retinopathy), nerve damage (neuropathy), and poor wound healing. These complications can have a significant impact on quality of life and overall health. Therefore, maintaining HbA1c levels within the recommended range is crucial for reducing the risk of these long-term effects. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_5');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_5');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_5" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[5]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_5" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<h2>What factors can influence HbA1c values?</h2>
<p>Several factors can influence HbA1c readings. Conditions like anemia or hemoglobinopathies can alter hemoglobin levels, affecting HbA1c accuracy. Changes in red blood cell lifespan due to recent blood loss, transfusion, or certain chronic conditions (e.g., kidney or liver disease) can skew results. Some medications impact glucose metabolism, thus influencing HbA1c. Racial and ethnic differences have been observed in HbA1c levels, requiring careful interpretation. Pregnancy also affects HbA1c, necessitating different evaluation standards for pregnant women. It&#8217;s important to consider these factors for accurate assessment of HbA1c results. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_6');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_6');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_6" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[6]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_6" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<h2>What lifestyle modifications can be made to regulate HbA1c?</h2>
<p>Chronic stress can raise blood glucose levels due to the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which can lead to higher HbA1c readings. Finding ways to mitigate this such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, mindfulness exercises, and adequate sleep may help. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_7');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_7');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_7" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[7]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_7" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> Smoking can increase HbA1c levels independently of glucose concentration. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_8');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_8');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_8" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[8]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_8" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> A higher BMI, often associated with increased fat mass, can lead to insulin resistance, which in turn may raise HbA1c levels. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_9');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_9');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_9" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[9]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_9" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> Conversely, regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, potentially lowering HbA1c. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_10');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_10');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_10" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[10]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_10" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> These lifestyle factors, along with dietary habits, play a significant role in determining HbA1c values and overall metabolic health. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_11');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2490_14('footnote_plugin_reference_2490_14_11');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2490_14_11" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[11]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2490_14_11" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>

<p>These supplements show promise in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing blood sugar levels and have been targets for therapeutic studies. However, it&#8217;s important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, especially for individuals with diabetes or pre-diabetes, as these supplements may interact with other medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From fluctuating hormones to lab analyzer variations, learn more about the nuance of blood test results and how you should interpret them.]]></description>
			

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At SiPhox Health, accuracy isn’t just a goal—it&#8217;s a commitment. Every blood test we conduct is rigorously vetted in labs that boast CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. Furthermore, our clients frequently validate their blood test results against industry giants like Quest and LabCorp, reporting consistent positive correlations <span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1">(see </span><a class="notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" tabindex="0" href="https://proto.life/2022/12/at-home-blood-testing-just-got-a-whole-lot-better/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="2"><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id-419479582"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></span></a><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="3">, for example)</span>. Yet, the realm of clinical lab testing is inherently nuanced, and despite our best efforts, variations can occur.<!-- notionvc: 25407253-776b-4609-a1ed-5cae82011b50 --></p>
<h3><strong>The Precision Paradigm</strong></h3>
<p>Given that a whopping 70% of medical decisions hinge on lab tests, the stakes for accuracy are high. However, despite our (and others’) best efforts, variance has widely been accepted as commonplace in laboratory testing with lab errors having a reported frequency of 0.012–0.6% of all test results. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2709_15('footnote_plugin_reference_2709_15_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2709_15('footnote_plugin_reference_2709_15_1');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2709_15_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2709_15_1" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></p>
<p>At SiPhox Health, we&#8217;re committed to transparency and excellence throughout our product&#8217;s development. Our collaboration with CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited labs ensures our tests undergo rigorous validation against traditional venous draws. Despite this, it&#8217;s important to recognize the inherent variability within laboratory testing. Instrument variations, calibrator differences among reagent manufacturers, and unique lab reference ranges introduce a degree of variability. Unlike some in the at-home diagnostics field, we openly discuss the limitations of our technology, acknowledging that discrepancies can occur between labs, especially on immunoassay systems. A recognized industry standard accepts up to a 15% variation in results, known as the coefficient of variability, even when analyzing the same blood sample on identical machines. For a detailed look at the acceptable ranges for each analyte, visit <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://datainnovations.com/allowable-total-error-table">this link</a></span>. State-of-the-art equipment notwithstanding, minor calibration differences or reagent quality issues can lead to variances in outcomes.</p>

Our</span><span style="color: var(--global--color-primary); font-family: var(--global--font-secondary); font-size: var(--global--font-size-base); background-color: var(--global--color-background);"> openness about these challenges underscores our commitment to quality and the continuous improvement of our services, ensuring we provide reliable and accurate health monitoring solutions.</span></p>
<h3><strong>SiPhox Liquichek Analysis</strong></h3>
<p>Immunoassays are scientific tests conducted in laboratories to find out how much of a specific substance is present in a fluid, often used to detect levels of biomarkers in the body. The Liquichek Immunoassay Control is a product that clinical labs use to make sure their immunoassay tests are accurate and dependable. These controls have known concentration levels and are used to verify analyzer performance and calibration needs. Ideally, when using different testing machines (analyzers) to measure the same Liquichek control sample, the results should be consistent. However, this method is imperfect and variations do occur.</p>
<p>SiPhox Health analyzed <a href="https://siphox.notion.site/Bio-Rad-Liquichek-Data-38550f998562408b83b0778621000685?pvs=4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">data from Bio-Rad</span></a> to see how much results can vary depending on the analyzer used across several Liquichek controls (L1, L2, and L3). We discovered that for some substances, like cortisol and insulin, the measured concentrations are fairly consistent across different analyzers. But for others, like testosterone and vitamin D, the results could vary dramatically, with discrepancies over 300% and 600%, respectively. This means that for these markers, different machines could show results that differ by more than six times, highlighting the challenge of ensuring uniformity in immunoassay testing across different equipment. (Note: the number of data points varies for each biomarker.)</p>

<h3><strong>Human Error</strong></h3>
<p>The inherent nature of at-home self-testing introduces a greater likelihood of human error compared to traditional sample collection methods. Common issues contributing to errors include insufficient sample quantity, contamination, and damaged samples (ex. smeared, hemolyzed), all of which are frequently cited as reasons for discrepancies in test results. To help counteract these potential sources of error, SiPhox Health provides free phlebotomy calls and recommends following specific collection guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circulation is important</strong>. Instead of testing immediately after rolling out of bed, drink some water, wash your hands in warm water to remove potential contaminants, do some light exercises to get the blood going, and ensure that your hands are warm. Collecting your sample while standing up can let gravity do some of the work.</li>
<li><strong>Use proper pricking technique</strong>. After wiping the fingertip with alcohol, let the residual disinfectant air-dry for about 30 seconds. If you have callused fingertips, try to find an area on the finger that is softer. Press the lancet down firmly until you hear a click and feel a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting the sample</strong>. Flip the hand over and use your other hand to massage the pricked finger, starting at the knuckle and gently gliding down toward the fingertip until a large drop is formed. Droplets should be large enough to drip off the fingertip. Collect four large drops in one square before moving to the next. Don’t take too long to collect one square since this could lead to poor absorption and serum separation.
<ul>
<li>Trouble collecting enough blood? SiPhox Health is releasing a patented finger pump!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shipping the test</strong>. Leave the card on the table for 30 minutes to an hour until it is completely dry to avoid smearing. Make sure to register your test, as unregistered tests cannot be analyzed by the lab. Samples are viable for 14 days, so ship them off in a timely manner to accommodate for transportation times.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Capillary Vs Venous</strong></h3>
<p>Capillary sampling has long since been used by the medical profession for those with difficult venous access, such as neonates, having shown a strong correlation with more traditional methods. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2709_15('footnote_plugin_reference_2709_15_2');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2709_15('footnote_plugin_reference_2709_15_2');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2709_15_2" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[2]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2709_15_2" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span> SiPhox Health is at the vanguard, now utilizing this technology as a less invasive but equally reliable alternative to traditional venous draws, allowing for at-home collection without sacrificing accuracy. Our laboratories have undertaken rigorous validation studies comparing capillary samples directly with venous draws ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our results are upheld.</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding Natural Variabilities</strong></h3>
<p>Some biomarkers are subject to natural variation. Understanding these inherent variations is crucial for accurate health assessments. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyclical Biological Patterns</strong>: Our hormonal landscape is dynamic, with cortisol and testosterone levels ebbing and flowing with the day&#8217;s rhythm. Other hormones such as TSH, estradiol, FSH, progesterone, and LH experience frequent fluctuations as well. <span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_2709_15('footnote_plugin_reference_2709_15_3');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_2709_15('footnote_plugin_reference_2709_15_3');" ><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2709_15_3" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[3]</span></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2709_15_3" class="footnote_tooltip"></span></span></li>
<li><strong>Influences of Daily Living</strong>: The rhythms of our daily activities, including dietary habits, physical activity, fasting, and sleep patterns, significantly sway our biomarker levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>To mitigate the impact of these natural oscillations, we recommend consistent, periodic testing. A morning fasting test, ideally at a consistent time after waking up with every test, is recommended to standardize results and mitigate daily fluctuations.</p>
<p>Many biomarkers, including those mentioned, are influenced by daily biological cycles and lifestyle factors. These variables mean that for a truly comparative analysis, simultaneous blood draws across different laboratories would need to be conducted at the same time to detect true result errors.</p>
<p>For analytes like Vitamin D and Testosterone that are not commonly measured, there exists a broader industry issue: differing results across laboratories based on the specific instruments used, such as those from Beckman, Abbott, or Roche. This variation underscores a broader industry issue regarding uniformity in testing outcomes.</p>
<p>At SiPhox Health, we&#8217;ve dedicated ourselves to ensuring our tests&#8217; repeatability and validity, particularly against traditional venous draws. Our extensive internal studies, conducted during our product&#8217;s alpha phase, have confirmed that our measurements are consistent and responsive to changes in lifestyle and supplementation. This robust validation process underscores our commitment to providing accurate, reliable health monitoring solutions that reflect the dynamic nature of human biology.</p>
<p>The following is data from one of our clients shared with permission illustrating the responsive nature of blood tests to lifestyle events:</p>
<p><a href="/hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2710" src="/hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled.png" alt="" width="1211" height="475" srcset="/hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled.png 1211w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-300x118.png 300w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-1024x402.png 1024w, /hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-768x301.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1211px) 100vw, 1211px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Data shared from a client with permission</em></p>
<p>In general, some of these measurements work better as serial measurements because one is able to establish a baseline and then see deviations. Right now, doctors rely on single measurements because of logistical issues. In reality, a single measurement of many biomarkers contains a lot of uncertainty because they can change easily.</p>
<h3><strong>Embracing the Complexity</strong></h3>
<p>Acknowledging these factors doesn’t undermine the value of blood tests; rather, it highlights the importance of context, serial measurements, and choosing reputable labs like SiPhox Health. We&#8217;re transparent about the inherent challenges we face and committed to pushing the boundaries for accuracy.</p>
<h3><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h3>
<p>Variability in lab results is a known entity, yet it doesn’t detract from the utility of these tests. Instead, it underscores the need for careful interpretation, consistency in testing conditions, and ongoing technological improvements. SiPhox Health is leading the charge, ensuring that you can access reliable, precise health insights from the comfort of your own home, this year we plan to fully replace our current ADX collection card-based kits with our superior SiPhox Home readers &#8211; the same accurate results with quicker turnaround. Our goal? To empower you with the information you need to make informed health decisions, today and into the future.</p>
